summary: "In this episode, we focus on Mortal Republic. We go through the several\
  \ different political organizations that Rome had \u2013 the kingdom, the republic,\
  \ and the empire -, and some of their major players, like the patricians, the Gracchi\
  \ brothers (Tiberius and Gaius), and Julius Caesar. We then ask if there are any\
  \ lessons we can take from the Roman Republic for modern politics, Great-Man vs.\
  \ Great-Ideas theories of History, and if History really does repeat itself."
