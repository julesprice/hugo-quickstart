summary: "Dr. Felix Warneken is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology\
  \ at the University of Michigan. He\u2019s interested in Developmental Psychology;\
  \ Culture; Cognition; and Comparative Animal Behavior. His research group addresses\
  \ questions like how and why human social life involves complex interactions between\
  \ individuals working together, and what cognitive skills allow them to do so. They\
  \ do so by examining the earliest forms of cooperation in young children, untangling\
  \ the processes shaping cooperation across development in different sociocultural\
  \ contexts, and comparing human cooperation with that of our closest evolutionary\
  \ relatives, the great Apes."
