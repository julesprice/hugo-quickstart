summary: 'Dr. Joseph Errington is Professor of Anthropology at Yale University. He
  studies language change as a source of insight into the ways languages constitute
  intimate parts of our everyday lives, and at the same time are foundational for
  large-scale institutions, social groups, and social dynamics. He has worked mostly
  in Indonesia, studying Javanese (90 million speakers), Indonesian (250 million speakers)
  and a range of Malay dialects. He has also worked on questions of language ideology
  and practice: how conceptions of language can shape and reflect social interests,
  naturalize images of social groups, and shape everyday ways of talking.'
