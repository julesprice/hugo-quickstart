summary: 'Dr. Michael Gurven is a Professor at the Department of Anthropology at the
  University of California, Santa Barbara, chair of the Integrative Anthropological
  Sciences Unit, and also head of the Evolutionary Anthropology and Biodemography
  Research Group. He is an evolutionary anthropologist aiming to explain behavior
  and physiological systems as adaptive solutions to competing demands of limited
  resource allocation. He employs ethnographic field settings as laboratories for
  testing hypotheses about human variation in behavior, psychology and physiology.
  Currently his research focuses on two broad, inter-related areas: biodemography
  of human health, lifespan and aging; and transitions in social and economic behavior.'
