summary: "In this episode, we talk about The Epistemic Innocence of Irrational Beliefs.\
  \ We start with some basic concepts, like \u201Cirrational beliefs\u201D, \u201C\
  epistemic irrationality\u201D, \u201Cepistemics functionality\u201D, and \u201C\
  epistemic innocence\u201D, and we apply them to a philosophical and scientific context.\
  \ We go through some examples where epistemic innocence applies, like self-narratives,\
  \ optimism and pessimism, mental disorders, romantic relationships, and religious\
  \ beliefs. Finally, we discuss how the epistemic innocence project might apply in\
  \ a clinical context, and in understanding how our normal cognition works."
