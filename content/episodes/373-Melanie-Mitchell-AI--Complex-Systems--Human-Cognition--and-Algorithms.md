summary: In this episode, we talk about AI. First, we ask if we are close to human-level
  AI, and also if the Turing test is really that relevant. Dr. Mitchell explains deep
  learning and neural networks, evolutionary computation, complex systems, and genetic
  algorithms. Then we get into conceptual abstraction, analogy-making, and visual
  recognition. We also discuss if AI systems should have built-in features (innate
  features). Finally, we talk about the impact that AI already has on our lives.
