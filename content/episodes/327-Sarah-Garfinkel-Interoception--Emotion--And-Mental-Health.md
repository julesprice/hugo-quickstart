summary: "Dr. Sarah Garfinkel is Professor of neuroscience and psychiatry based at\
  \ the University of Sussex and the Brighton and Sussex Medical School. Her research\
  \ is focused on the link between interoception and emotion and memory. In 2018,\
  \ she was selected as one of 11 researchers on the Nature Index 2018 Rising Stars.\
  \ Dr. Garfinkel's research focuses on interoception, the ability to sense one\u2019\
  s own body, and the link between interoception and the brain. She specifically focuses\
  \ on the heartbeat, and has shown that the heartbeat, and perception thereof, influences\
  \ the way people process fear. Her research has furthermore shown that autistic\
  \ people experience difficulty judging their heartbeat, causing anxiety and stress.\
  \ This research has led to the development of a new therapy technique called interoception-directed\
  \ therapy, which aims to reduce anxiety in autistic individuals."
