summary: Dr. Peter DeScioli is Assistant Professor in the Department of Political
  Science at Stony Brook University. His research investigates how the human mind
  uses principles of strategy to solve problems in the social world. Much of his work
  has focused on moral condemnation, especially the functions of morally judging other
  people, moralistic punishment, and moral impartiality. In another line of work,
  he studies how people form alliances, how they choose their loyalties to others,
  and how they display and conceal their loyalties. A third project looks at our sense
  of ownership by using a virtual environment to observe resource disputes in the
  laboratory. In recent years, he has been designing online games for experiments
  about politics, including redistribution of wealth, social safety nets, alliance
  formation, and political negotiation.
