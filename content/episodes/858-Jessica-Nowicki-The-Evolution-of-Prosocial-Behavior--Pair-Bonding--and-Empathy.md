summary: Dr. Jessica Nowicki is a Research Scientist at the Wu Tsai Neurosciences
  Institute at Stanford University. She is interested in the mechanistic basis of
  prosocial behavior in early vertebrates. She uses poison frogs, which display considerable
  variation in sociality among closely related species, for comparatively identifying
  neural correlates of pair bonding within the clade. In order to verify the functional
  involvement of these correlates, she then couples this with functional tests on
  the strongly pair bonding species, Ranitomeya imitator.
