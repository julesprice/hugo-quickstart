summary: Dr. Alecia Carter is Associate Professor in the Department of Anthropology
  at University College London. Her current research investigates (1) how primates
  respond to the deaths of others and what this can tell us about the evolution of
  cognition and emotion and (2) how individuals access information to make decisions.
  In particular, she studies how individuals use their social environment to access
  information, and how their phenotype, their individual characteristics, may limit
  their use of that information. Her previous research addressed how and why animals&#39;
  behavior varies from others but is consistent through time.
