summary: Dr. Derek Leben is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of
  Pittsburgh, Johnstown. He works at the intersection of ethics, cognitive science,
  and emerging technologies. In his new book, Ethics for Robots, Dr. Leben argues
  for the use of a particular moral framework for designing autonomous systems based
  on the Contractarianism of John Rawls. He also demonstrates how this framework can
  be productively applied to autonomous vehicles, medical technologies, and weapons
  systems.
