summary: "Dr. Christopher Stringer is a British physical anthropologist noted for\
  \ his work on human evolution. He is a Research Leader in Human Origins at the Natural\
  \ History Museum. His early research was on the relationship of Neanderthals and\
  \ early modern humans in Europe, but through his work on the Recent African Origin\
  \ model for modern human origins, he now collaborates with archaeologists, dating\
  \ specialists, and geneticists in attempting to reconstruct the evolution of modern\
  \ humans globally. Now he\u2019s co-director of the follow-up Pathways to Ancient\
  \ Britain project, as part of their funding from the Calleva Foundation, which has\
  \ also contributed to the foundation of their new Centre for Human Evolution Research.\
  \ As well as many scientific papers, he\u2019s also written a number of books, most\
  \ recently, Britain: one million years of the human story (2014, with Rob Dinnis)\
  \ and Our Human Story (2018, with Louise Humphrey)."
