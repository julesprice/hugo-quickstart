summary: David Pearce is a prominent figure within the transhumanism movement and
  one of the co-founders of the World Transhumanist Association, currently rebranded
  and incorporated as Humanity+. He approaches ethical issues from a lexical negative
  utilitarian perspective. Pearce maintains a series of websites devoted to transhumanist
  topics and what he calls the "hedonistic imperative", a moral obligation to work
  towards the abolition of suffering in all sentient life. His self-published internet
  manifesto, The Hedonistic Imperative (1995), outlines how pharmacology, genetic
  engineering, nanotechnology and neurosurgery could converge to eliminate all forms
  of unpleasant experience from human and non-human life, replacing suffering with
  "gradients of bliss". Pearce calls this the "abolitionist project".
