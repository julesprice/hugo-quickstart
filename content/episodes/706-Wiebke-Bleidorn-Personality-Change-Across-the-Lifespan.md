summary: Dr. Wiebke Bleidorn is a Professor of Psychology at the University of Zurich.
  Dr. Bleidorn examines the conditions, mechanisms, and consequences of personality
  change. Personality change is an emerging subfield that straddles the areas of personality,
  developmental, and social psychology. Dr. Bleidorn's work sits at this intersection.
  Her current research involves questions about the cultural and social conditions
  under which people change, the genetic and environmental mechanisms that account
  for change, and the consequences of these changes for psychological functioning
  and important life outcomes.
