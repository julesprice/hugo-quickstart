summary: "Dr. Tania Reynolds is a Social Psychology postdoctoral researcher at the\
  \ Kinsey Institute. She received her PhD in Social Psychology from Florida State\
  \ University under Dr. Roy Baumeister and Dr. Jon Maner. Her research examines how\
  \ pressure to compete for social and romantic partners asymmetrically affects the\
  \ competitive behaviors and well-being of men and women. Through a joint appointment\
  \ with the Gender Studies department, Dr. Reynolds offers courses on human sexuality\
  \ and sex/gender differences. As a collaborative research team with Justin Garcia\
  \ and Amanda Gesselman, she hopes to examine the dispositional predictors and physiological\
  \ correlates of individuals\u2019 romantic relationship experiences, as well as\
  \ how these associations may differ across gender and sexual orientation."
