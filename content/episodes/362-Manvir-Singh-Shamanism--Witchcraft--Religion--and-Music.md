summary: Dr. Manvir Singh just graduated with a PhD in human evolutionary biology
  from Harvard University, with a focus on cognitive and evolutionary anthropology.
  His research program aims to explain why societies develop complex, recurrent traditions
  such as shamanism, witchcraft, origin myths, property rights, sharing norms, lullabies,
  dance, music, and gods, as these have appeared in all types of societies across
  the globe, from nomadic hunter-gatherer bands to complex, industrial, mega-urbanized
  states.
