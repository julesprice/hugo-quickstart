summary: "In this episode, we go through a number of topics in the philosophy of videogames\
  \ and simulated reality. We first discuss the Robert Nozick\u2019s experience machine\
  \ thought experiment, and several of its philosophical implications, including the\
  \ nature of reality, our experience of reality, hedonism, and reducing suffering\
  \ in the world. We also talk about fearmongering surrounding advanced forms of AI,\
  \ and fearing \u201Cblack boxes\u201D, and also how we constantly delegate decisions\
  \ to other people whose decision-making processes we do not understand. We talk\
  \ about social media, and what it means to have \u201Cfake relationships\u201D.\
  \ We then get into the philosophy of videogames, and we go through the ethics of\
  \ worldbuilding; how people explore their personal identities through avatars and\
  \ archetypes; and role-playing in videogames and real life."
