summary: Dr. Moshe Hoffman is a Research Scientist at MIT Media Lab &amp; Lecturer
  at Harvard's Department of Economics. He applies game theory, models of learning
  and evolution, and experimental methods, to try to decipher the (often subconscious
  and subtle) incentives that shape our social behavior, preferences, and ideologies.
  Dr. Hoffman obtained his Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Chicago, Booth
  School of Business and his B.S. in Economics from the University of Chicago. He
  also co-designed and teaches "Game Theory and Social Behavior" which lays out a
  lot of the evidence and models behind this approach.
