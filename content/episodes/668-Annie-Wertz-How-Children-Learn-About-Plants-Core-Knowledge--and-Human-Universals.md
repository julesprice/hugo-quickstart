summary: Dr. Annie Wertz is Research Group Leader of the MPRG Naturalistic Social
  Cognition at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin. Her research
  investigates how infants and young children think about and learn from other people
  in naturalistic circumstances. Her work provided the first evidence that human infants
  do indeed possess behavioral and social learning strategies that are selective to
  plants (e.g., infants avoid plant dangers and selectively learn that some plants
  are edible).
