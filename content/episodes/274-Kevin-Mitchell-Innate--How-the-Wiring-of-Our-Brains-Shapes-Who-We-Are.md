summary: "Dr. Kevin Mitchell is Associate Professor of Genetics and Neuroscience at\
  \ Trinity College Dublin. He is interested in the development of connectivity in\
  \ the brain, specifically in how this process is controlled by genes and how mutations\
  \ in such genes affect the connectivity of neuronal circuits, influence behavior\
  \ and perception and contribute to disease. His research group uses genetic approaches\
  \ in the mouse to address these questions, and they are also involved in collaborative\
  \ research looking at the genetics and phenotypic manifestations of synaesthesia\
  \ and schizophrenia in humans. He\u2019s the author of a book that came out last\
  \ year, Innate: How the Wiring of Our Brains Shapes Who We Are."
