summary: Dr. Andrew Thomas is a Lecturer in Psychology at Swansea University, UK.
  His research is concerned with the differences in mating strategies within and between
  the sexes. This includes environmental and social factors which contribute to this
  variance and whether mating preferences themselves are reactive to environmental
  changes over short term periods. He also has a secondary interest in cyber-psychology
  and online interaction; particularly how one represents oneself using internet avatars
  and aliases.
