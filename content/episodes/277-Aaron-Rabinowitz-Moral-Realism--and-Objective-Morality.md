summary: 'Aaron Rabinowitz is an Adjunct Professor (PTL) in the Rutgers Philosophy
  department and the Rutgers Honors College. He specializes in ethics, metaethics,
  and AI. His work focuses on developing a secular moral realism that is compatible
  with the problem of moral luck. He also hosts two philosophy podcasts: Philosophers
  in Space and Embrace the Void. The goal of both shows is to make philosophy accessible
  for everyone, using science fiction and existential horror.'
