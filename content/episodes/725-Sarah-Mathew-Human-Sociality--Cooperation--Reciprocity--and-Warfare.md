summary: Dr. Sarah Mathew is Associate Professor in the School of Human Evolution
  and Social Change at Arizona State University. She studies the evolution of human
  ultra-sociality and the role of culture in enabling it. She is especially interested
  in how humans evolved the capacity to cooperate with millions of genetically unrelated
  individuals, and how this links to the origins of moral sentiments, prosocial behavior,
  norms, and large-scale warfare.
