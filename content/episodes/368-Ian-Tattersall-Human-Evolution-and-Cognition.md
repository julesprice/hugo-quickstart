summary: In this episode, we talk about the study of the human fossil record, and
  several aspects of human evolution, with a focus on the genus Homo. We discuss how
  the Pleistocene conditions might have affected human evolution; the role of culture;
  and the cognitive revolution. We also refer to what is a modern human, and the evolution
  of language and symbolism.
