summary: 'Thomas Coleman III is PhD student at Coventry University, and a Postdoctoral
  Researcher at the University of Bialystok as part of the Society and Cognition Unit.
  He draws on multiple approaches from across the sciences and humanities, to study
  the origins, development, and maintenance of (non)religious worldviews. His research
  focuses on three areas: Identifying and measuring components of nonreligious worldviews;
  computer simulated models of the cognitive and social dynamics leading to (non)belief
  in supernatural agents; investigating how and why moral motivations are stereotypically
  attributed to religious, as opposed to nonreligious factors.'
