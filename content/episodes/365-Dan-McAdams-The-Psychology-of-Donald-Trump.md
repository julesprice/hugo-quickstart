summary: "Dr. Dan P. McAdams is the Henry Wade Rogers Professor of Psychology and\
  \ professor of human development and social policy at Northwestern University. Dr.\
  \ McAdams is most well-known for formulating a life-story theory of human identity,\
  \ which argues that modern adults provide their lives with a sense of unity and\
  \ purpose by constructing and internalizing self-defining life stories or \u201C\
  personal myths.\u201D He\u2019s a leader in the recent emergence within the social\
  \ sciences of narrative approaches to studying human lives \u2013 approaches that\
  \ place stories and storytelling at the center of human personality. His theoretical\
  \ and empirical writings focus on concepts of self and identity in contemporary\
  \ American society and on themes of power, intimacy, redemption, and generativity\
  \ across the adult life course. He\u2019s also the author of nearly 300 scientific\
  \ articles and chapters, numerous edited volumes, and seven books, including \u201C\
  The Strange Case of Donald J. Trump: A Psychological Reckoning\u201D."
