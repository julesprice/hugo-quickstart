summary: Dr. Michael Inzlicht is a Research Excellence Faculty Scholar at the University
  of Toronto. His primary appointment is as Professor in the Department of Psychology,
  but he is also cross-appointed as Professor at the Rotman School of Management.
  Dr. Inzlicht conducts research that sits at the boundaries of social psychology,
  cognitive science, and neuroscience. Although he has published papers on the topics
  of prejudice, academic performance, and religion, his most recent interests have
  been in the topics of self-control, where he borrows methods from affective and
  cognitive neuroscience to understand the underlying nature of self-control, including
  how it is driven by motivation.
