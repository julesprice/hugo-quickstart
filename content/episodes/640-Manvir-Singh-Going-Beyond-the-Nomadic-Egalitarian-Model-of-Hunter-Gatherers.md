summary: Dr. Manvir Singh is Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Institute of Advanced
  Study in Toulouse.  His research program aims to explain why societies develop complex,
  recurrent traditions such as shamanism, witchcraft, origin myths, property rights,
  sharing norms, lullabies, dance, music, and gods, as these have appeared in all
  types of societies across the globe, from nomadic hunter-gatherer bands to complex,
  industrial, mega-urbanized states.
