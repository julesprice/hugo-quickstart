summary: "Dr. Jonathan Marks is Professor of Anthropology at the University of North\
  \ Carolina at Charlotte. His primary training is in biological anthropology and\
  \ genetics. In 2006 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the\
  \ Advancement of Science. In 2012 he was awarded the First Citizen\u2019s Bank Scholar\u2019\
  s Medal from UNC Charlotte. In recent years he has been a Visiting Research Fellow\
  \ at the ESRC Genomics Forum in Edinburgh, at the Max Planck Institute for the History\
  \ of Science in Berlin, and a Templeton Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study\
  \ at Notre Dame. He is a significant figure in anthropology, especially on the topic\
  \ of race. Dr. Marks is skeptical of genetic explanations of human behavior, of\
  \ \"race\" as a biological category, and of science as a rationalistic endeavor.\
  \ He\u2019s the author of books like The Alternative Introduction to Biological\
  \ Anthropology, Tales of the Ex-Apes: How We Think about Human Evolution, and Is\
  \ Science Racist?."
