summary: Dr. Felipe De Brigard is Fuchsberg-Levine Family Associate Professor at Duke
  University. Most of his research focuses on the way in which memory and imagination
  interact. So far, he has explored ways in which episodic memory both guides and
  constrains episodic counterfactual thinking (i.e., thoughts about alternative ways
  in which past personal events could have occurred), and how this interaction affects
  the perceived plausibility of imagined counterfactual events. He also explores the
  differential contribution of episodic and semantic memory in the generation of different
  kinds of counterfactual simulations, as well as the effect of counterfactual thinking
  on the memories they derive from. In addition, his research attempts to understand
  how prior experience helps to constrain the way in which we reconstruct episodic
  memories.
