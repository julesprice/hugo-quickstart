summary: "Dr. Philip Goff is a philosopher and consciousness researcher at Durham\
  \ University, UK. His main research focus is trying to explain how the brain produces\
  \ consciousness. He thinks we need to radically rethink our understanding of matter\
  \ in order to explain consciousness, in something like the way Einstein radically\
  \ rethought the nature of space and time. Dr. Goff also has a sideline in political\
  \ philosophy, focusing on issues pertaining to taxation, globalization and social\
  \ justice. He\u2019s also the author of the book Consciousness and Fundamental Reality."
