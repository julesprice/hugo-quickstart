summary: 'Dr. Alberto Acerbi is a Lecturer in Psychology in the Centre for Culture
  and Evolution at Brunel University London. He is a cognitive/evolutionary anthropologist
  with a particular interest in computational science. The main question that drives
  his research is: is it possible to find some general factors determining why some
  cultural traits succeed and others do not? He is interested in particular in contemporary
  cultural phenomena, and he uses a naturalistic, quantitative, and evolutionary approach
  with different methodologies, especially individual-based models and quantitative
  analysis of large-scale data. He published a book recently, Cultural Evolution in
  the Digital Age.'
