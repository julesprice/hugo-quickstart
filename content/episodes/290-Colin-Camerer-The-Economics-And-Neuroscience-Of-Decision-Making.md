summary: "Dr. Colin F. Camerer is the Robert Kirby Professor of Behavioral Finance\
  \ and Economics at the California Institute of Technology, where he teaches cognitive\
  \ psychology and economics. His work seeks a better understanding of the psychological\
  \ and neurobiological basis of decision-making in order to determine the validity\
  \ of models of human economic behavior. His research uses mostly economics experiments\u2014\
  and occasionally field studies\u2014to understand how people behave when making\
  \ decisions (e.g., risky gambles for money), in games, and in markets (e.g., speculative\
  \ price bubbles). In 2013, Dr. Camerer was named a MacArthur Fellow."
