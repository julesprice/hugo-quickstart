summary: "Dr. Terrence Deacon is currently Professor of Anthropology and member of\
  \ the Cognitive Science faculty at the University of California, Berkeley. His theoretical\
  \ interests include the study of evolution-like processes at multiple levels, including\
  \ their role in embryonic development, neural signal processing, language change,\
  \ social processes, and focusing especially on how these different processes interact\
  \ and depend on each other. Professor Deacon's research has combined human evolutionary\
  \ biology and neuroscience, with the aim of investigating the evolution of human\
  \ cognition. He\u2019s the author of The Symbolic Species: The Coevolution of Language\
  \ and the Brain, and his most recent book, Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from\
  \ Matter, explores the relationship between thermodynamic, self-organizing, evolutionary\
  \ and semiotic processes and provides a new technical conception of information\
  \ that explains both its representational and normative properties."
