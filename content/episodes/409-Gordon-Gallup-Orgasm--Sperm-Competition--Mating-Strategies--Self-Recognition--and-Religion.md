summary: In this episode, we focus on evolutionary psychology. We talk about the evolution
  of orgasm in males and females, and the functions that it serves, sperm competition,
  intra-copulatory competition, the sedative and antidepressant properties of semen.
  We also tackle paternity uncertainty, and the mating strategies that men and women
  resort to, particularly applied to mate guarding and infidelity. Then we discuss
  self-recognition and self-awareness in humans and other animals. Finally, we talk
  about what is a mind (and if other species have minds), tonic immobility, and religion.
