summary: "Dr. Kyle Thomas recently received his Ph.D. in experimental psychology from\
  \ Harvard University, where he developed his research program on the psychology\
  \ of common knowledge under his advisor, Steven Pinker. He is currently the Chief\
  \ Scientist at MotiveMetrics, where they turn cutting-edge psychological science\
  \ into software tools that can accurately reveal true motivations from publicly\
  \ available data. In short, they help marketers understand why people buy\u2014\
  or don\u2019t\u2014at the click of a button. Software hasn\u2019t eaten marketing\
  \ research yet, but they\u2019re working very hard to change that."
