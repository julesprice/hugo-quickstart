summary: Dr. Melanie MacEacheron is a Lecturer in the School of Social and Behavioral
  Sciences at Arizona State University. Her current research focus is women's psychology
  as potential or actual mothers or allomothers, and sex differences in mateships
  and romantic relationships. Of particular interest to her, is our ability to creatively
  label or act on evolved desires in order to serve our evolutionary interests, even
  or especially where these are not consciously known to us, and to influence others.
