summary: "Dr. Max Krasnow is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at\
  \ Harvard University. His research interests include: evolutionary psychology, evolution\
  \ of sociality, psychology of cooperation and punishment, ecological rationality,\
  \ and psychology of foraging. Dr. Krasnow\u2019s primary line of research focuses\
  \ on the evolutionary origins and computational design of the mechanisms underlying\
  \ human cooperation and social behavior. Why are we more generous, trusting and\
  \ cooperative, but also vengeful and punitive than an otherwise rational analysis\
  \ would predict? He has been exploring how the answers to these questions neatly\
  \ fall out by considering reliable features of the ancestral ecology and simple\
  \ cognitive mechanisms that could evolve to benefit from them."
