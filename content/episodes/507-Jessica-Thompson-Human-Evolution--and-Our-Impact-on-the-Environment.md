summary: Dr. Jessica Thompson is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Yale University.
  Dr. Thompson specializes in human evolution, and especially those aspects that can
  be revealed through the analysis of ancient animal bones found at archaeological
  sites (zooarchaeology). She leads the Malawi Ancient Lifeways and Peoples Project
  in Malawi, central Africa, where she has maintained a field site since 2009. This
  multidisciplinary work combines archaeological science, evolutionary theory, and
  hunter-gatherer ethnography to develop and interpret the first cultural and paleoenvironmental
  chronologies in the region that span the transition from the last Ice Age.&nbsp;
