summary: "Dr. Kevin Dorst is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics\
  \ and Philosophy at MIT. He works on epistemology, logic, language, and their intersections.\
  \ In epistemology he\u2019s interested in what we should think (the belief-credence\
  \ connection), why we should think it (foundations), and how we should think about\
  \ what we should think (higher-order uncertainty). In logic, he\u2019s interested\
  \ in various models of these things; in language, he\u2019s interested the semantics\
  \ of various statements about them. More recently, he\u2019s been thinking about\
  \ the connection between epistemology and cognitive science and psychology."
