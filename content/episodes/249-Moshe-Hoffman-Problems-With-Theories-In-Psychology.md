  and subtle) incentives that shape our social behavior, preferences, and ideologies.
  Dr. Hoffman obtained his Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Chicago, Booth
  School of Business and his B.S. in Economics from the University of Chicago. He
  also co-designed and teaches "Game Theory and Social Behavior" which lays out a
  lot of the evidence and models behind this approach.
