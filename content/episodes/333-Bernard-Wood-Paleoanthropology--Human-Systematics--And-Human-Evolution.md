summary: "Dr. Bernard Wood is University Professor of Human Origins at the Center\
  \ for the Advanced Study of Human Paleobiology at the Columbian College of Arts\
  \ &amp; Sciences at George Washington University. He is a medically trained paleoanthropologist.\
  \ His research interests are all related in one way or another to a long-standing\
  \ pre-occupation with hominin systematics. How can we improve our ability to recognize\
  \ species in the fossil record, and how can we do a better job of reconstructing\
  \ their phylogenetic relationships? His current research interests are phylogeny\
  \ reconstruction, hominin systematics, dental evolution, evolvability within the\
  \ hominin clade, and diet reconstruction. He\u2019s the author of several books,\
  \ including Human Evolution: A Very Short Introduction, and Human Evolution: A Guide\
  \ to Fossil Evidence."
