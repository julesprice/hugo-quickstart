summary: Dr. Kristen Syme is research associate at the Faculty of Behavioral and Movement
  Sciences at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. She received her BA in anthropology from
  the University of Delaware where she developed an interest in using evolutionary
  theory to investigate mental health and behavioral phenomena that are diagnosed
  and treated as diseases and deviations according to the Western medical paradigm.
  She conducted her MA research on suicidal behavior in 53 cultures and received her
  MA in 2014. Her research interests broadly concern the evolved interpersonal functions
  of psychological and behavioral phenomena. Her MA thesis tested two evolutionary
  models of suicidal behavior against the ethnographic record, and my dissertation
  research is a continuation of this project.
