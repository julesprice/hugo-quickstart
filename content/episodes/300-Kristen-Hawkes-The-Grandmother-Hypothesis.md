summary: "Dr. Kristen Hawkes is Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the University\
  \ of Utah. Dr. Hawkes, an expert in human evolution and sociobiology, is the author\
  \ of several studies on the \u201Cgrandmother hypothesis,\u201D which asserts that\
  \ many of the characteristics that distinguish us from our ape ancestors are thanks\
  \ to the thoughtful care of our grandmothers. Her research is based on ethnographic\
  \ observation studies of hunter-gatherer communities such as the Ach\xE9 and Hadza.\
  \ She has also developed mathematical models to model evolution over time and trace\
  \ the influence of grandmothers on human lifespan. Combining mathematical modelling\
  \ and observational studies she also researches the effects of fire on ancient hunter-gatherers."
