summary: 'Dr. Geoffrey West is Shannan Distinguished Professor at the Santa Fe Institute.
  He is a theoretical physicist whose primary interests have been in fundamental questions
  in physics, especially those concerning the elementary particles, their interactions
  and cosmological implications. His long-term fascination in general scaling phenomena
  evolved into a highly productive collaboration on the origin of universal scaling
  laws that pervade biology from the molecular genomic scale up through mitochondria
  and cells to whole organisms and ecosystems. He is the author of several books,
  including Scale: The Universal Laws of Life, Growth, and Death in Organisms, Cities,
  and Companies.'
