summary: "Dr. Renee Magnan is Associate Professor and Director of Experimental Training\
  \ in the Department of Psychology at Washington State University. She applies social\
  \ psychological theory to address issues in preventive health behaviors and health\
  \ behavior promotion. Specifically, much of the research in her lab focuses on understanding\
  \ the role that affect (e.g., worry) plays on health decisions and behavior (e.g.,\
  \ smoking cessation, exercise, cannabis). She is interested in both how one\u2019\
  s feelings about health behaviors may influence their decisions to engage in health\
  \ behavior and also how health behaviors may influence one\u2019s feelings. Both\
  \ perspectives can provide important insight to identify targets for interventions\
  \ to prevent negative health consequences and promote wellness."
