summary: "Dr. Jerome Kagan is Professor of Psychology Emeritus at Harvard University.\
  \ Professor Kagan's research, on the cognitive and emotional development of a child\
  \ during the first decade of life, focuses on the origins of temperament. He has\
  \ tracked the development of inhibited and uninhibited children from infancy to\
  \ adolescence. Dr. Kagan\u2019s research indicates that shyness and other temperamental\
  \ differences in adults and children have both environmental and genetic influences.\
  \ A shy adult is more likely to have been high-reactive (fearful) in infancy and\
  \ childhood than their bold and sociable counterparts, who were most likely low-reactive.\
  \ He has served on the National Institute of Mental Health and on the National Research\
  \ Council. His books include Galen\u2019s Prophecy: Temperament in Human Nature\
  \ and Three Seductive Ideas."
