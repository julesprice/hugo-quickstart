  Here, we talk about Behavioral Genetics; MISTRA; the types of studies done in Human
  Behavioral Genetics; what the studies with twins and adoptees tell us about human
  nature; some of the most interesting finding from the MISTRA; responses to people
  who only care about socialization; gender differences; and the concept of race and
  ancestry in Behavioral Genetics, and its implications.
