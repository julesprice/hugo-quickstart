summary: Here, we talk about what is Evolutionary Anthropology; the conciliation between
  Evolutionary Psychology and Human Behavioral Ecology; the role of biology and culture
  in determining gender roles; how the studies done with the Pimbwe add nuance to
  the study of gender roles; the importance of sexual selection in the creation and
  exaggeration of sexual dimorphisms; what factors influence reproductive skew in
  humans; the interaction between mating, parenting and subsistence in the behavior
  directed at offspring; how the number of mates and the number of years spent with
  each mate influence fitness; mate selection in different ecological conditions;
  the problem with romanticizing hunter-gatherer and prehistorical peoples.
