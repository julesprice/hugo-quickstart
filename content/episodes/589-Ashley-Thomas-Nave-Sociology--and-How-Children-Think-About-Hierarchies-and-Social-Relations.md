summary: Dr. Ashley Thomas is a postdoctoral fellow at the center for research on
  open and equitable scholarship at MIT. She is interested in humans as a social species.
  She investigates what infants, toddlers, and children think about social relationships
  (i.e., their naive sociology). She has studied how they think and feel about social
  hierarchy (i.e. situations where there is a 'winner' and a 'loser' or when someone
  is 'in charge.'). She has also studied people's moral judgments of parenting decisions.
