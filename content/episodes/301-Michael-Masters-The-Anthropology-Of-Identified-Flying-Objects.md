summary: 'Dr. Michael Masters is Professor of Anthropology at Montana Tech. His research
  centers on investigating human ocular, orbital, midfacial, cerebral and neurocranial
  morphology, and how competition among these features may act to constrain the eye
  and surrounding ocular tissues during ontogeny, as it relates to the disparate incidence
  &amp; severity of astigmatism and juvenile-onset myopia. Further research interests
  center on investigating hominin biocultural evolution, astrobiology, astronomy and
  the physics of time as they relate to the UFO phenomenon. On that pic, he has written
  a book, Identified Flying Objects: A Multidisciplinary Scientific Approach to the
  UFO Phenomenon.'
