summary: In this episode, we talk about aggression, and the evolution of yawning.
  We first tackle the evolutionary bases of aggression, and the social functions that
  it serves, and how we can apply this knowledge to combat bullying. We mention sex
  differences, and also how aggression changes across human development, with focus
  on men and testosterone. We then get into the evolutionary function of yawning,
  and ask if it really is socially contagious.
