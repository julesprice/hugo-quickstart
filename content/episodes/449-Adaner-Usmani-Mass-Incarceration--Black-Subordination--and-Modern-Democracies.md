summary: In this episode, we focus on topics like mass incarceration, discrimination
  against black Americans and the root causes of their subordination, modern democracies
  and their weaknesses, creating a Left that does not deny human nature, and the viability
  of communism in current political systems. We discuss the causes and motivations
  behind mass incarceration in the US. We talk about the contentious issue of high
  crime rates in black communities, and the causes behind them. We address the narrative
  of the destruction of the nuclear family and a culture that go against personal
  responsibility, coming from the conservatives. We talk about praise and blame. We
  discuss modern democracies, the major threats to democracy, the democracies that
  distribute power among their citizens, and the ones that withhold it. And we also
  discuss political struggle and communism. And, finally, we talk about the need to
  include biology in sociological analyses, and about a potential biologically-informed
  Left.
