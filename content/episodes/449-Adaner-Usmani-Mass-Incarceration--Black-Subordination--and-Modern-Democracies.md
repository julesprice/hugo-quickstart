summary: 'Dr. Adaner Usmani is Assistant Professor of Sociology and Social Studies
  at Harvard University. His research is driven by two questions: Why do some people
  flourish while others suffer? And, what explains why, in some places but not others,
  movements or policies emerge to challenge or moderate this inequality? In one project,
  he explores when and why ordinary individuals manage to coordinate collective action,
  and how well these patterns explain the forward march of democracy and the extent
  of economic redistribution.'
