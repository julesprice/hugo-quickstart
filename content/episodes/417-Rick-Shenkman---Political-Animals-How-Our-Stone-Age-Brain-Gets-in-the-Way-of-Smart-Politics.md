summary: In this episode, we talk about Political Animals. We go through topics like
  evolutionary mismatch; how good we really are at reading politicians, and if it
  is easy for them to lie to us; self-deception in politics; the role the media play
  in politics; the problem with presenting information in the form of stories; empathizing
  with strangers in modern large-scale societies; relying on gut feelings; and solutions
  to current political problems.
