summary: "Dr. Melanie Meng Xue is assistant professor in the Social Science Division\
  \ at New York University in Abu Dhabi. Her research lies at the intersection of\
  \ economic history and political economy. She has studied the rise of gender-equitable\
  \ beliefs and the deterioration of civil society in the context of imperial China.\
  \ By tracing the impact of historical events over time and in various institutional\
  \ settings, her work isolates the role of values, beliefs and norms in shaping economic\
  \ and political disparities. Another strand of Dr. Meng Xue\u2019s research concerns\
  \ the decoding of folklore and mythology as a new approach to understanding historical\
  \ values."
