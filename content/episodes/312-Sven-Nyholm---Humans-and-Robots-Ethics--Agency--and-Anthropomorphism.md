summary: 'Dr. Sven Nyholm is an Assistant Professor of Philosophical Ethics at Utrecht
  University. His main areas of research are applied ethics (especially the ethics
  of technology), ethical theory, and the history of ethics. More specifically, he
  has recently published on love-relationships and biomedical enhancements, sex robots,
  motivation-enhancements, accident-algorithms for self-driving cars, deep brain stimulation,
  happiness and well-being, meaning in life, and interpersonal respect and moral reasoning.
  His work also focuses on the ethics of automated driving, human-robot collaboration,
  deep brain stimulation (including its effect on the self), and disability and the
  goods of life. He is especially interested in how robotization and other types of
  automation affect traditional human values, as well as in existential questions
  raised by new technological developments. He has a new book coming out, Humans and
  Robots: Ethics, Agency, and Anthropomorphism.'
