summary: Dr. Leonid Tiokhin is Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study
  at the University of Amsterdam, and a postdoctoral researcher at the Eindhoven University
  of Technology. Dr. Tiokhin is a meta-scientist who studies the forces that shape
  how scientists do their work and make inferences from the populations that they
  study. Much of his research focuses on how incentive structures affect scientific
  efficiency and reliability, and how we can improve the recognition and reward structures
  in science.
