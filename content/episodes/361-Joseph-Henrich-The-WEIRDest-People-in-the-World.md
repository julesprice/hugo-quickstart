summary: "In this episode, we focus on Dr. Henrich\u2019s new book, The WEIRDest People\
  \ in the World. We first talk about innate anchors, how societies evolved in complexity,\
  \ the role that agriculture played, and the various aspects of WEIRD psychology.\
  \ We then get into the Catholic Church\u2019s Marriage and Family Program of the\
  \ Middle Ages, and the different aspects of sociality that it influenced, including\
  \ marriage, monogamy, urbanization, legal systems, work ethics, and even science\
  \ and the Enlightenment values. We also talk about how we might evolve psychologically\
  \ in the future, social engineering, and the replication crisis in social psychology.\
  \ Toward the end, we answer some questions from a follower."
