summary: Dr. Daniel Conroy-Beam is Assistant Professor of Psychology in the Department
  of Psychological &amp; Brain Sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara
  (UCSB). He uses an evolutionary perspective to understand how mate preferences are
  linked to actual mating outcomes. Specifically, he is interested in how mate preferences
  are integrated with one another computationally in order to make mating decisions.
  His work combines agent-based modeling of mate choice evolution with studies of
  real couples to compare and explore candidate algorithms for how people select their
  mating strategies, evaluate potential mates, and regulate their relationships.
