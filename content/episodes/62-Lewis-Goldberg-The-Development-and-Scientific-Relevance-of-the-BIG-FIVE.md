summary: Dr. Lewis Goldberg is an American personality psychologist and a Professor
  Emeritus at the University of Oregon. He is closely associated with the lexical
  hypothesis, that says that any culturally important personality characteristic will
  be represented in the language of the particular culture. This hypothesis led to
  the discovery of a five-factor structure of personality trait adjectives (which
  he dubbed the Big Five).
