summary: "Dr. Marco Del Giudice is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology\
  \ at the University of New Mexico. In his work he explores a wide range of topics\
  \ at the intersection of human behavior, evolution, and development. His approach\
  \ is interdisciplinary and driven by the quest for theoretical synthesis. Over the\
  \ years he has developed some broad, integrative models: the Adaptive Calibration\
  \ Model of individual differences in stress responsivity (with Bruce Ellis and Birdie\
  \ Shirtcliff); an evolutionary-developmental model of sex differences in attachment\
  \ styles; and a unifying life history framework for evolutionary psychopathology.\
  \ Most of his current empirical work is devoted to testing, advancing, and refining\
  \ these models with a variety of research methods. He\u2019s the author of Evolutionary\
  \ Psychopathology: A Unified Approach."
