summary: Dr. Carrie Mongle is Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology
  at Stony Brook University and the Turkana Basin Institute. She also heads the Mongle
  Lab. Her research aims to reconstruct the major trends and transitions that characterize
  hominin diversity and evolution. Her ongoing work towards that goal involves (1)
  the discovery and description of new hominin fossils from the Turkana Basin in Kenya;
  (2) quantification of morphological variation; and (3) comprehensive phylogenetic
  analyses founded on the careful character assessment of both craniodental and postcranial
  characters. In addition, Dr. Mongle is interested in evaluating the relationship
  between variation, evolvability, and macroevolution in the primate dentition.
