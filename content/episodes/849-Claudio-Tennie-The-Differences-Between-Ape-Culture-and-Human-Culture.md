summary: "Dr. Claudio Tennie is a Tenured Research Group Leader (\u201CTools and Culture\
  \ among Early Hominins\u201D) in the Department of Early Prehistory and Quaternary\
  \ Ecology at the University of T\xFCbingen. In addition, he is an adjunct scientist\
  \ at the Lester E. Fisher Center for the Study and Conservation of Apes. His main\
  \ research triangulates what (if anything) makes human cognition unique - as well\
  \ as why (and relatedly, when this happened and how often). In particular, he uses\
  \ various methods and pathways to study the factors and the prehistorical beginnings\
  \ that enabled the typical modern human &quot;variant of culture&quot;: cumulative\
  \ culture of know-how."
