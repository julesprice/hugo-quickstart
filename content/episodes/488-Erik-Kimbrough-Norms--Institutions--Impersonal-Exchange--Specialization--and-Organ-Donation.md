summary: Dr. Erik Kimbrough is an associate professor of economics at the Smith Institute
  for Political Economy and Philosophy in the Argyros School of Business and Economics

  of prosociality, cooperation and conflict resolution and to identify the origins
  of economic institutions such as property rights. He has also worked on finding
  ways to increase the supply of transplantable organs, measuring the spitefulness
  of individuals, understanding the sources of asset price bubbles, evaluating individual
  theory of mind, and capturing the discovery process underlying specialization and
  trade, among other topics.
