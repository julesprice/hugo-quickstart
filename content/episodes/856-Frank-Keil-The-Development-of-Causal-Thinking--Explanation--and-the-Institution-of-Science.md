summary: 'Dr. Frank Keil is Charles C. &amp; Dorathea S. Dilley Professor of Psychology
  &amp; Linguistics and Director of the Cognition and Development lab at Yale University.
  At the most general level, he is interested in how we come to make sense of the
  world around us. One set of his studies is examining a level of explanatory insight
  that functions without knowledge of specific mechanisms and instead involves knowing
  what sorts of properties are causally potent in a domain and how they are likely
  to interact. He also asks how emerging knowledge of concrete mechanisms can link
  up frequency-based information with abstract explanatory principles as well as cause
  distortions in judgment. He is the author of Developmental Psychology: The Growth
  of Mind and Behavior, and other books.'
