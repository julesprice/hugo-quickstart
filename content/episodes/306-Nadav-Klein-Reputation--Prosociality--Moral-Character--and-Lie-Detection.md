summary: Dr. Nadav Klein is an Assistant Professor of Organisational Behaviour at
  INSEAD. His research focuses on the basic processes of judgment that affect how
  people make decisions, process information, and evaluate others and themselves.
  Some of the findings Nadav has explored are the surprising reputational benefits
  of being a little bit nice to other people, the ability of groups to detect lies,
  people's weak desire to be seen as moral and strong desire not to be seen as immoral,
  and people's overestimation of how much information they use to make decisions.
