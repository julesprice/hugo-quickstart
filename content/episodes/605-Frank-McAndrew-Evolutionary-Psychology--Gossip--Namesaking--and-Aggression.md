summary: 'Dr. Francis McAndrew is the Cornelia H. Dudley Professor of Psychology at
  Knox College. He studies human social behavior from an evolutionary perspective.
  He is especially interested in understanding the psychology of everyday life. Why
  do we enjoy gossip about celebrities? Why do some people name their children after
  themselves while others do not? His current research projects are concerned with
  aggression, gossip, and creepiness, and he writes a blog for Psychology Today Magazine
  titled "Out of the Ooze: Navigating the 21st Century with a Stone-Age Mind." Dr.
  McAndrew is also interested in environmental psychology, which is the study of the
  relationship between people and their physical environments, both natural and human-made.
  He has written a successful textbook in this area, Environmental Psychology.'
