summary: "Dr. Mark Alfano is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the Delft University\
  \ of Technology and the Australian Catholic University. Dr. Alfano uses tools and\
  \ methods from philosophy and the sciences to explore topics in moral psychology,\
  \ epistemology, and digital humanities. He studies how people become and remain\
  \ virtuous, how values become integrated into people's lives, and how these virtues\
  \ and values are (or fail to be) manifested in their perception, thoughts, feelings,\
  \ deliberations, and behavior. One of the guiding themes of his work is that moral\
  \ philosophy without psychological content is empty, but psychological investigation\
  \ without philosophical insight is blind. He\u2019s the author of books like Character\
  \ as Moral Fiction, and Nietzsche's Moral Psychology."
