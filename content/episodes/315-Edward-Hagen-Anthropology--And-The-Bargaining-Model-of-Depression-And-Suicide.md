summary: Dr. Edward Hagen is Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology at Washington
  State University. His research takes an evolutionary approach to non-infectious
  diseases, with a focus on mental health. He investigates tobacco use in the larger
  context of human use of plant secondary compounds. He investigates depression, suicide,
  and deliberate self-harm as potential signaling strategies. Child growth and development
  is a research theme that grew out of his work on postpartum depression. He has also
  recently begun testing evolutionary models of leadership, as part of his more general
  interest in the evolution of human social organization. Finally, he has published
  a number of theoretical papers on evolutionary approaches to ontogeny, cognition,
  and behavior.
