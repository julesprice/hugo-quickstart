summary: In this episode, we talk about human nature and empathy. We start with a
  bit of developmental psychology, and discuss how we study babies, and how good they
  really are as models for human nature and the innateness of behavior. We also deal
  with mind-body dualism, and how people think about the physical world and the social
  world differently. We then get into moral development. We also talk about Against
  Empathy, the distinction between emotional and cognitive empathy, compassion, and
  psychopathy. We tackle the link between morality and violence, and we talk a little
  bit about dehumanization. Finally, Dr. Bloom lifts the veil on his upcoming book,
  about pleasure and/in pain.
