summary: 'Dr. Samir Okasha is a Professor of Philosophy of Science at the University
  of Bristol. He is a winner of the Lakatos Award for his book Evolution and the Levels
  of Selection. He was appointed a Fellow of the British Academy in 2018, and he is
  also the President of the European Philosophy of Science Association. He has broad
  philosophical interests, though most of his research falls into two main areas:
  (i) philosophy of biology / evolutionary theory; and (ii) epistemology /philosophy
  of science. Within philosophy of biology, he is especially interested in foundational
  and conceptual questions surrounding evolutionary theory. For many years, his research
  focused on the ''levels of selection'' question in evolutionary biology, and the
  related issue of individual versus group conflicts of interest.'
