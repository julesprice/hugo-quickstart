summary: Dr. Khandis Blake is an evolutionary social psychologist at The University
  of Melbourne. She is an expert in gendered conflict. Her research considers how
  behavior, attitudes, and culture associated with gender are influenced by the interplay
  between nature, nurture, and the state of the economy. Herself and her collaborators
  propose that gendered phenomena such as inimate partner violence, attitudes toward
  abortion, and male-male aggression arise partially out of market conditions that
  shift the bargaining power between men and women. Second, she investigates the causes
  and consequences of female competition and the conditions under which female sexualization
  elevates women's agency. Third, she develops methodological tools to advance the
  psychosocial study of female ovulation and ovarian hormones. Finally, she is interested
  in the social contexts eliciting aggression, especially male-to-female aggression
  and intimate partner violence.
