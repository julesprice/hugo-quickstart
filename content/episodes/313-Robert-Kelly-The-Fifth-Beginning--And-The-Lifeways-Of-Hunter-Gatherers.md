summary: "Dr. Robert Kelly is Professor of Archaeology at the University of Wyoming.\
  \ Dr. Kelly has shaped and contributed much to our understanding of hunter-gatherer\
  \ societies. He has a deep interest in Western North American archaeology, especially\
  \ in the Great Basin area. Current understanding of hunter-gatherer mobility and\
  \ foraging patterns are also influenced strongly by his research, fieldwork, and\
  \ ethnology. By examining the Pleistocene colonization of the Americas by examining\
  \ artifacts and lithic technology, Dr. Kelly reconstructs past life-ways and compares\
  \ them to current foraging societies, and examines human adaptation to climate change\
  \ during different periods in the past. He\u2019s the author of books like The Foraging\
  \ Spectrum: Diversity in Hunter-Gatherer Lifeways, and The Fifth Beginning: What\
  \ Six Million Years of Human History Can Tell Us about Our Future."
