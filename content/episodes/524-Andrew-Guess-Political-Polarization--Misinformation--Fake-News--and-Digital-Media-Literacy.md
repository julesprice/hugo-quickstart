summary: Dr. Andrew Guess is an assistant professor of politics and public affairs
  at Princeton University. His research and teaching interests lie at the intersection
  of political communication, public opinion, and political behavior. Via a combination
  of experimental methods, large datasets, machine learning, and innovative measurement,
  he studies how people choose, process, spread, and respond to information about
  politics. Recent work investigates the extent to which online Americans' news habits
  are polarized (the popular "echo chambers" hypothesis), patterns in the consumption
  and spread of online misinformation, and the effectiveness of efforts to counteract
  misperceptions encountered on social media.
