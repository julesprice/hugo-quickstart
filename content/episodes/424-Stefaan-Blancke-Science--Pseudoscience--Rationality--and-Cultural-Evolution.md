summary: In this episode, we talk about philosophy of science. We focus on the demarcation
  problem, the scientific method, and how to distinguish science from pseudoscience.
  We also talk about the evolutionary bases of pseudoscience, and how cultural attraction
  theory applies to the diffusion of pseudoscientific and scientific beliefs. We discuss
  if evolutionary psychology is really a science. Finally, we talk a little bit about
  selves as cultural attractors.
