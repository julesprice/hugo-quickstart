summary: "In this episode, we talk neuroscience and cognitive science. We start with\
  \ the evolution of the brain, and what is the best way to understand it, and go\
  \ through the modularity approach, the idea of functional localization, and the\
  \ triune brain model. We then move into mechanisms like neuromodulation, neuroplasticity,\
  \ response to damage, and neural regeneration. We talk about Dr. Anderson\u2019\
  s massive redeployment (or reuse) hypothesis of brain evolution. Finally, we talk\
  \ about how important interdisciplinarity is to studying the brain."
