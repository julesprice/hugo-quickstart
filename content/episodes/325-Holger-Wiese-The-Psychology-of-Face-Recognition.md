summary: Dr. Holger Wiese is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at
  Durham University, where he runs an EEG lab. He is mainly interested in face recognition
  and face perception. He investigates how we recognize familiar faces, how we learn
  new facial identities, why people are more accurate at remembering faces of their
  own ethnic and age groups, how we perceive age, sex, and attractiveness in unfamiliar
  faces, and how our knowledge about other people is structured in semantic memory.
  He is also interested in how these aspects of face and person perception change
  across the adult lifespan.
