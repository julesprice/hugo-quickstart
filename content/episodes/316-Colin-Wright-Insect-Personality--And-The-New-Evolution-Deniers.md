summary: Dr. Colin Wright is Eberly Fellow in the Department of Biology at Pennsylvania
  State University. His research explores the effects of animal personality on collective
  behavior and colony success. Using a combination of laboratory and field experiments,
  he tests for relationships between group personality composition, inter-colony differences
  in collective behavior and behavioral flexibility, and colony performance. He uses
  social spiders (genus Stegodyphus) and paper wasps (genus Polistes) to probe these
  topics.
