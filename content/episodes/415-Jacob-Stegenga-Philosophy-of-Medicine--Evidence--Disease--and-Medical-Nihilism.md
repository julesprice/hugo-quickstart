summary: In this episode, we talk about philosophy of medicine. We first discuss what
  is philosophy of medicine, and then go through some of the major questions asked
  by philosophers of the discipline, like what is evidence, what is effectiveness,
  and what is a disease. We also talk about sources of evidence, like randomized control
  trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, and we mention the plurality of reasoning strategies
  appealed to by the epidemiologist Sir Bradford Hill. Finally, we discuss what is
  medical nihilism, and we Dr. Stegenga gives us a short teaser to his next book,
  focused on the sciences of sexual desire.
