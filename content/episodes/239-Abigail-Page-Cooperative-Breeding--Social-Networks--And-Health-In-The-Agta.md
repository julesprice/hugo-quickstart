summary: "Dr. Abigail Page is MRC Research Fellow at the Department of Population\
  \ Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Her research is\
  \ focused on understanding the relationship between the environment (both social\
  \ and natural) and behavior, and ultimately how this influences health and wellbeing.\
  \ Her background is in evolutionary approaches to human behavior (in particular\
  \ Human Behavioral Ecology), therefore her research seeks to test hypotheses developed\
  \ from evolutionary theory and ultimately, to understand the function of any given\
  \ behavior. Dr. Page\u2019s interests are also influenced by Evolutionary Medicine\
  \ and Applied Evolutionary Anthropology and Demography."
