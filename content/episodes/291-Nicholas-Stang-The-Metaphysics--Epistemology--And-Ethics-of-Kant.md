summary: "Dr. Nicholas Stang is Associate Professor in the Philosophy Department of\
  \ the University of Toronto, and also a Humboldt Research Fellow at the Humboldt\
  \ University in Berlin. His primary research interests are metaphysics and its history\
  \ (mainly in German philosophy). His first book, Kant\u2019s Modal Metaphysics,\

  \ Heidegger. He also works on contemporary metaphysics and aesthetics. His side\
  \ interests include: Jewish philosophy, early analytic philosophy, philosophy of\
  \ mathematics, and critical theory."
