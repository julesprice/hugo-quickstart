summary: In this episode, we talk about the evolution of play. First, we define play
  from a biological perspective, including five different criteria for a particular
  behavior to be classified as play. We talk about the three different categories
  of play (locomotor, object, and social). We also discuss play signals, role reversals,
  self-handicapping, the diversity of play, its downsides and costs, pseudo-copulatory
  play in spiders, and the surplus resources theory. Finally, We address of question
  of play possibly being behind certain elements of human culture, like rituals and
  religion.
