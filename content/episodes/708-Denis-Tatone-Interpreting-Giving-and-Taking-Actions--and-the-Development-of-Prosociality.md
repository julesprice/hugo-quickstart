summary: Dr. Denis Tatone is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Cognitive Development Center
  at Central European University. He is a cognitive scientist broadly interested in
  the evolution and development of social cognition. His research focuses on how the
  mind represents the social world in terms of its constituent interactions, relations,
  and structures. He strives to develop a mechanistically tractable account of how
  humans from the first years of life form and flexibly transition among these representations.
