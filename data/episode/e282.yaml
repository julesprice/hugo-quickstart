shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 7th, 2019.  \nDr. Menelaos Apostolou is currently\
  \ an Associate Professor at the University of Nicosia, Cyprus. He was born in Athens,\
  \ Greece and he completed his post-graduate and graduate studies in the United Kingdom.\
  \ He has published several peer-reviewed papers, books and chapters in books in\
  \ the area of evolutionary psychology.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on the evolutionary\
  \ bases of singlehood, parent-offspring conflict and mating control, and the evolution\
  \ of human sexuality. We start with singlehood, and discuss it as a contextual strategy,\
  \ and also why so many people in modern societies are single and have difficulty\
  \ getting and retaining a mate. We also refer to mating in traditional (hunter-gatherer)\
  \ and historical societies, and the psychological costs of being single. We then\
  \ move on to mating control by parents, how parents manipulate their offspring\u2019\
  s mate choices, and how societies developed mating control institutions. Finally,\
  \ we address the complex issue of the evolution of homosexuality and bisexuality\
  \ in humans.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:04  The evolution of singlehood  \n10:12  Singlehood\
