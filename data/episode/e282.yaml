shownotes: "<p>Dr. Menelaos Apostolou is currently an Associate Professor at the University\
  \ of Nicosia, Cyprus. He was born in Athens, Greece and he completed his post-graduate\
  \ and graduate studies in the United Kingdom. He has published several peer-reviewed\
  \ papers, books and chapters in books in the area of evolutionary psychology.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we focus on the evolutionary bases of singlehood, parent-offspring\
  \ conflict and mating control, and the evolution of human sexuality. We start with\
  \ singlehood, and discuss it as a contextual strategy, and also why so many people\
  \ in modern societies are single and have difficulty getting and retaining a mate.\
  \ We also refer to mating in traditional (hunter-gatherer) and historical societies,\
  \ and the psychological costs of being single. We then move on to mating control\
  \ by parents, how parents manipulate their offspring\u2019s mate choices, and how\
  \ societies developed mating control institutions. Finally, we address the complex\
  \ issue of the evolution of homosexuality and bisexuality in humans.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
