shownotes: '<p>Dr. James Zimring is Thomas W. Tillack Professor of Experimental Pathology
  at the University of Virginia. He is the author of What Science Is and How It Really
  Works (2019). His latest book is Partial Truths: How Fractions Distort Our Thinking.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on Partial Truths. We start with the premise of the
  book, and explain what a fraction is. We go through some biases and heuristics,
  like the confirmation bias and the availability heuristic, and talk about their
  evolution. We discuss bias within the criminal justice system. We talk about finding
  patterns where they do not exist, as in conspiracy theories and prophecies. We discuss
  why the Universe appears to be designed. We talk about the bad uses of statistics
  in science. We discuss social cognition, and an interactionist model of human reasoning,
  as opposed to an intellectualist one. Finally, we ask if it would really be good
  to overcome errors of reasoning.</p>
