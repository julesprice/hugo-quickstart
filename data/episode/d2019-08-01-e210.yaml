  \ human sociality. We talk about how sociality evolved from Old World monkeys to\
  \ chimpanzees and to humans. We refer to the role of biological kin selection, and\
  \ the biological traits that provided a basis for the cultural evolution of kin\
  \ systems. We discuss the social function of kin systems, their limits, and group\
  \ identities beyond kin.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Read\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty\
