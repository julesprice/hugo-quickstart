  \ She is also a Chartered member of the British Psychological Society and a Senior\
  \ Fellow of the Higher Education Academy. Her interests include mating behaviors,\
  \ preferences, and strategies; male psychology; and body image/identity and wellbeing.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about sex differences in mating behavior, male psychology,\
  \ and the psychology of body modifications. We first discuss sex differences in\
  \ mating strategies and mate preferences, for both short-term and long-term relationships.\
  \ We then get into male psychology, and discuss the effects of testosterone and\
  \ how it varies in romantic relationships. We discuss aggression, and the misconceptions\
  \ people hold about aggressive males, and issues regarding domestic violence. We\
  \ also talk about sex differences in competition. We ask about the psychological\
  \ impact of gender roles, and if the concept of \u201Ctoxic masculinity\u201D is\
  \ useful in any way. Finally, we talk about the psychology of body modifications,\
  \ and their impact on mental wellbeing.</p>\n"
