shownotes: "Dr. Hakwan Lau is Principal Investigator for the Laboratory for Consciousness\
  \ at Riken Institute. He works on the neural mechanisms of conscious perception,\
  \ attention, and sensory metacognition, using human fMRI and Bayesian computational\
  \ modeling. He is the author of In Consciousness We Trust: The Cognitive Neuroscience\
  \ of Subjective Experience.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on In Consciousness We\
  \ Trust. We talk about approaching consciousness from the perspective of cognitive\
  \ neuroscience, and issues with approaches from physics and philosophy. We discuss\
  \ different notions of consciousness, and the distinction between global and local\
  \ theories of consciousness. We talk about the neural correlates of consciousness\
  \ line of research, lesion and simulation studies, and localizationist and modular\
  \ perspectives of the brain. We also talk about Michael Gazzaniga, the split-brain\
  \ patients, and the interpretative theory of consciousness. We discuss the functions\
  \ of consciousness. We talk about what we can learn from AI research. We discuss\
  \ what we really know about animal consciousness, and if AI can be conscious. We\
  \ talk about how social and clinical scientists approach consciousness. Finally,\
  \ we discuss the hard problem of consciousness.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n\
