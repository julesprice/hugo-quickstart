  State University, where he is on the faculty of Lyman Briggs College, the Departments
  of Philosophy and Computer Science &amp; Engineering, and the Ecology, Evolution
  and Behavior program. His research involves empirical and philosophical questions

  <p>In this episode, we focus on An Instinct for Truth. We go through some of the
  traits that characterize (or should characterize) scientists, like curiosity, honesty,
  skepticism, and intellectual humility. We talk about moral values that orient science,
  and the importance of failure. We discuss the scientific method, the demarcation
  problem, and pseudoscience. We talk about the relationship between science and ethics.
  Finally, we ask if science is a cultural construct.</p>
