shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 22nd 2022.  \nDr. Robert Pennock is University Distinguished\
  \ Professor at Michigan State University, where he is on the faculty of Lyman Briggs\
  \ College, the Departments of Philosophy and Computer Science & Engineering, and\
  \ the Ecology, Evolution and Behavior program. His research involves empirical and\
  \ philosophical questions that relate to evolutionary biology, cognitive science,\
  \ and the scientific character, such as the evolution of altruism, complexity, and\
  \ intelligence. He is the author of books like An Instinct for Truth: Curiosity\
  \ and the Moral Character of Science.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on An Instinct\
  \ for Truth. We go through some of the traits that characterize (or should characterize)\
  \ scientists, like curiosity, honesty, skepticism, and intellectual humility. We\
  \ talk about moral values that orient science, and the importance of failure. We\
  \ discuss the scientific method, the demarcation problem, and pseudoscience. We\
  \ talk about the relationship between science and ethics. Finally, we ask if science\
  \ is a cultural construct.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:51  The traits of\
