  \ about cognitive archaeology. First, we go through some basics, and ask what are\
  \ archaeological remnants, and where archaeology starts in our evolutionary history,\
  \ and we also talk about cumulative culture, and the discipline of cognitive archaeology.\
  \ We discuss if modern hunter-gatherers make for good models of ancient peoples,\
  \ and what we can learn about cognition from ancient artifacts. We ask if technology\
  \ expands our cognitive capacities, and the get into more specific topics, like\
  \ the relationship between tool-making and tool-use and conceptualization, and language.\
  \ We also talk about numeracy and literacy.</p>\n"
