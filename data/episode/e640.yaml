shownotes: "Dr. Manvir Singh is Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Institute of Advanced\
  \ Study in Toulouse.  His research program aims to explain why societies develop\
  \ complex, recurrent traditions such as shamanism, witchcraft, origin myths, property\
  \ rights, sharing norms, lullabies, dance, music, and gods, as these have appeared\
  \ in all types of societies across the globe, from nomadic hunter-gatherer bands\
  \ to complex, industrial, mega-urbanized states.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ a recent paper of his, \u201CHuman social organization during the Late Pleistocene:\
  \ Beyond the nomadic-egalitarian model\u201D. We break down the nomadic-egalitarian\
  \ hunter-gatherer model. Dr. Singh presents his diverse histories model, and we\
  \ discuss the implications it has for our evolved psychology, and how we think about\
  \ evolutionary mismatches. We discuss how human societies get organized, the origins\
  \ of agriculture, the transition to large-scale agricultural societies, and non-agricultural\
  \ state societies. We also talk about the sympathetic plot in fiction, and its psychological\
  \ origins. Finally, we discuss how to think about the functionality of beliefs.\n\
