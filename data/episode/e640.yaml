  \ develop complex, recurrent traditions such as shamanism, witchcraft, origin myths,\
  \ property rights, sharing norms, lullabies, dance, music, and gods, as these have\
  \ appeared in all types of societies across the globe, from nomadic hunter-gatherer\
  \ bands to complex, industrial, mega-urbanized states.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we talk about a recent paper of his, \u201CHuman social organization during the\
  \ Late Pleistocene: Beyond the nomadic-egalitarian model\u201D. We break down the\
  \ nomadic-egalitarian hunter-gatherer model. Dr. Singh presents his diverse histories\
  \ model, and we discuss the implications it has for our evolved psychology, and\
  \ how we think about evolutionary mismatches. We discuss how human societies get\
  \ organized, the origins of agriculture, the transition to large-scale agricultural\
  \ societies, and non-agricultural state societies. We also talk about the sympathetic\
  \ plot in fiction, and its psychological origins. Finally, we discuss how to think\
  \ about the functionality of beliefs.</p>\n"
