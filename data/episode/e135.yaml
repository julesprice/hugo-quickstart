shownotes: "<p>Dr. Rebecca Sear is Reader at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical\
  \ Medicine (LSHTM), teaching demography and researching human reproductive behaviour\
  \ from an evolutionary perspective. She is trained in zoology, biological anthropology,\
  \ and statistics, and subsequently worked first in a social science institution\
  \ (London School of Economics) and then in an institution of global and public health\
  \ (LSHTM). Having been exposed to a variety of disciplines, she is particularly\
  \ interested in how the natural, social and medical sciences can be integrated as\
  \ we try to understand our own species, and aims to conduct research somewhere inbetween\
  \ these disciplines. She is particularly interested in taking a comparative perspective\
  \ to understanding human reproductive behaviour, and exploring why such behaviour\
  \ varies between, as well as within, populations. In 2008, she co-founded the European\
  \ Human Behaviour and Evolution Association, and she\u2019s currently Honorary Secretary\
  \ of the British Society for Population Studies and a Board Member of the Evolutionary\
  \ Anthropology Society.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about Human Behavioral\
  \ Ecology (HBE), and some specific aspects of human behavior that it addresses.\
  \ We start off by talking about the differences and the relationship between HBE\
  \ and Evolutionary Psychology (EP) and other similar and close sciences of human\
  \ behavior. We address the issue with studies done on WEIRD (Western, Educated,\
  \ Industrialized, Rich, and Developed) and non-WEIRD societies; transcultural variation\
  \ and human universals; and comparing modern and natural environments. Then, we\
  \ tackle specific topics like human mating and reproduction; cooperative breeding\
  \ and alloparenting in humans; the developmental consequences of father absence;\
  \ the evolution of menopause; and other related topics.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n\
