shownotes: "Dr. Rebecca Sear is Reader at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical\
  \ Medicine (LSHTM), teaching demography and researching human reproductive behaviour\
  \ from an evolutionary perspective. She is trained in zoology, biological anthropology,\
  \ and statistics, and subsequently worked first in a social science institution\
  \ (London School of Economics) and then in an institution of global and public health\
  \ (LSHTM). Having been exposed to a variety of disciplines, she is particularly\
  \ interested in how the natural, social and medical sciences can be integrated as\
  \ we try to understand our own species, and aims to conduct research somewhere inbetween\
  \ these disciplines. She is particularly interested in taking a comparative perspective\
  \ to understanding human reproductive behaviour, and exploring why such behaviour\
  \ varies between, as well as within, populations. In 2008, she co-founded the European\
  \ Human Behaviour and Evolution Association, and she\u2019s currently Honorary Secretary\
  \ of the British Society for Population Studies and a Board Member of the Evolutionary\
  \ Anthropology Society.  \nIn this episode, we talk about Human Behavioral Ecology\
  \ (HBE), and some specific aspects of human behavior that it addresses. We start\
  \ off by talking about the differences and the relationship between HBE and Evolutionary\
  \ Psychology (EP) and other similar and close sciences of human behavior. We address\
  \ the issue with studies done on WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich,\
  \ and Developed) and non-WEIRD societies; transcultural variation and human universals;\
  \ and comparing modern and natural environments. Then, we tackle specific topics\
  \ like human mating and reproduction; cooperative breeding and alloparenting in\
  \ humans; the developmental consequences of father absence; the evolution of menopause;\
  \ and other related topics.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:01  Human Behavioral Ecology, Evolutionary\
