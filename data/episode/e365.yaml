shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 13th, 2020.  \nDr. Dan P. McAdams is the Henry Wade Rogers\
  \ Professor of Psychology and professor of human development and social policy at\
  \ Northwestern University. Dr. McAdams is most well-known for formulating a life-story\
  \ theory of human identity, which argues that modern adults provide their lives\
  \ with a sense of unity and purpose by constructing and internalizing self-defining\
  \ life stories or \u201Cpersonal myths.\u201D He\u2019s a leader in the recent emergence\
  \ within the social sciences of narrative approaches to studying human lives \u2013\
  \ approaches that place stories and storytelling at the center of human personality.\
  \ His theoretical and empirical writings focus on concepts of self and identity\
  \ in contemporary American society and on themes of power, intimacy, redemption,\
  \ and generativity across the adult life course. He\u2019s also the author of nearly\
  \ 300 scientific articles and chapters, numerous edited volumes, and seven books,\
  \ including \u201CThe Strange Case of Donald J. Trump: A Psychological Reckoning\u201D\
