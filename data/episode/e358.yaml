shownotes: "<p>Dr. Michael McCullough is a professor of psychology at the University\
  \ of California San Diego, where he directs the Evolution and Human Behavior Laboratory.\
  \ Most of the research they conduct in the lab is focused on extending an evolutionary\
  \ analysis to some of the key psychological features of human social life. He is\
  \ the author of several books, including \u201CBeyond Revenge: The Evolution of\
  \ the Forgiveness Instinct,\u201D and, the most recent one, \u201CThe Kindness of\
  \ Strangers: How a Selfish Ape Invented a New Moral Code\u201D.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we focus on Dr. McCullough\u2019s new book, The Kindness of Strangers.\
  \ We talk about the evolutionary bases of altruism, including kin selection, reciprocal\
  \ altruism, indirect reciprocity, and group selection. We discuss how empathy works,\
  \ and the people we tend to empathize and help the most. We then go through seven\
  \ ages and eras that Dr. McCullough presents on the book as having influenced the\
  \ cultural evolution of our altruism: the Age of Orphans, the Age of Compassion;\
  \ the Age of Prevention, the First Poverty Enlightenment Era, the Humanitarian Big\
  \ Bang, the Second Poverty Enlightenment, and the Age of Impact. In our current\
  \ age, we focus on the role that the internet and social media play, and also on\
  \ effective altruism. Finally, we talk about practical reasoning, and the issues\
  \ we have to deal with in the future.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n"
