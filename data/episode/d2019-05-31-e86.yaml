  \ I talk with Dr. McGinn about minds and consciousness. More specifically, about\
  \ what is a mind; the different types of minds; how to avoid dualism; if the phenomenology\
  \ of consciousness can be scientifically explained; the continuity of mental capacities\
  \ between animals; a couple of science fiction proposals, like creating conscious\
  \ machines, and mind uploading; and animal rights.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:54\
  \ Types of minds &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>02:16 But, what is a mind? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>06:20\
  \ Is the mind a single entity?</p>\n<p>09:06 Does dualism still make sense?</p>\n\
  <p>14:08 The mind of a bat &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>19:28 Are mental capacities\

  <p>28:48 Does consciousness have several parts?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>32:32 Are there degrees\

  \ for consciousness?</p>\n<p>40:09 Is it possible to create conscious machines?</p>\n\
  <p>44:07 And what about uploading minds to computers?</p>\n<p>48:25 Types of minds\
