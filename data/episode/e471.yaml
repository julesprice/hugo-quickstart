  \ Psychology Emerita at the University of Notre Dame. She has written extensively\
  \ on issues of character and moral development. Dr. Narvaez\u2019 research explores\
  \ questions of species-typical and species-atypical development in terms of wellbeing,\
  \ morality, and sustainable wisdom. She examines how early life experience (the\
  \ evolved nest) influences moral functioning and wellbeing in children and adults.\
  \ She integrates evolutionary, anthropological, neurobiological, clinical, developmental\
  \ and education sciences in her work. Her 2014 book - Neurobiology and the Development\
  \ of Human Morality - won the 2015 William James Book Award from the APA and the\
  \ 2017 Expanded Reason Award for research. She also writes a popular blog for Psychology\
  \ Today called \u201CMoral Landscapes.\u201D\n\nIn this episode, we talk about moral\
  \ development. First, we define morality, and talk about the concept of the \u201C\
  evolved nest\u201D. We ask if morality is innate, and discuss moral foundations\
  \ theory and its limitations. We get into moral development, and talk about the\
  \ role of genetics, the parents, and the wider community. We talk about multiples\
  \ inheritances genes, epigenetics, developmental plasticity, basic needs, the microbiome,\
  \ local and macro ecological heritages). We mention the importance of social interaction\
  \ in child development. We discuss human flourishing, and what we can learn from\
  \ indigenous societies. Finally, we talk about studying human behavior through a\
  \ multidisciplinary approach.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n01:09  What is morality?\
