shownotes: "<p>In this episode, we focus on Dr. Henrich\u2019s new book, The WEIRDest\
  \ People in the World. We first talk about innate anchors, how societies evolved\
  \ in complexity, the role that agriculture played, and the various aspects of WEIRD\
  \ psychology. We then get into the Catholic Church\u2019s Marriage and Family Program\
  \ of the Middle Ages, and the different aspects of sociality that it influenced,\
  \ including marriage, monogamy, urbanization, legal systems, work ethics, and even\
  \ science and the Enlightenment values. We also talk about how we might evolve psychologically\
  \ in the future, social engineering, and the replication crisis in social psychology.\
  \ Toward the end, we answer some questions from a follower.</p>\n"
