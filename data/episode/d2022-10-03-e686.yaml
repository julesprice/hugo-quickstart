shownotes: "<p>Dr. Olivier Morin has a full-time tenured research position at the\
  \ Institut Jean Nicod in Paris. He is also a Research group leader at the Max Planck\
  \ Institute for Geoanthropology in Jena, with the Minds and Traditions Research\
  \ Group. He is the author of How Traditions Live and Die.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we focus on How Traditions Live and Die. We first define \u201Ctradition\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cculture\u201D. We talk about theories of cultural transmission, like\
  \ memetics, and forms of cultural transmission, like imitation, learning, communication,\
  \ teaching, and social influence. We discuss the Theory of Diffusion Chains, and\
  \ what makes for cultural success. We talk about transmission within and between\
  \ generations. We discuss the evolution of human culture, and why culture is rare\
  \ in the animal kingdom. We also talk about human nature, and ask if there could\
  \ be human societies without culture.</p>\n"
