shownotes: "<p>Dr. Laurence Kirmayer is James McGill Professor and Director of the\
  \ Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry at McGill University. He directs\
  \ the Culture &amp; Mental Health Research Unit at the Jewish General Hospital where\
  \ he conducts research on the mental health of Aboriginal peoples, and mental health\
  \ services for immigrants and refugees. He is the editor of Cultural Consultation:\
  \ Encountering the Other in Mental Health Care.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus\
  \ on Cultural Consultation. We first discuss what cultural psychiatry is, why cultural\
  \ diversity is a challenge to mental health care, and the different approaches to\
  \ addressing diversity in mental health services. We delve into the challenges faced\
  \ by migrants; how gender and ethnicity interact with hierarchies of power, and\
  \ why that matters in a clinical context; working with marginalized communities;\
  \ and working in rural and remote communities. We talk about how \u201Chealers\u201D\
  \ can help with psychological issues, and the issues with psychological traits that\
  \ are stigmatized in certain cultural contexts. Finally, we discuss if culture influences\
  \ how mental disorders manifest themselves, and how the social sciences can contribute\
  \ to psychiatry.</p>\n"
