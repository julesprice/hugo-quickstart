shownotes: "<p>Dr. Jessica Nowicki is a Research Scientist at the Wu Tsai Neurosciences\
  \ Institute at Stanford University. She is interested in the mechanistic basis of\
  \ prosocial behavior in early vertebrates. She uses poison frogs, which display\
  \ considerable variation in sociality among closely related species, for comparatively\
  \ identifying neural correlates of pair bonding within the clade. In order to verify\
  \ the functional involvement of these correlates, she then couples this with functional\
  \ tests on the strongly pair bonding species, Ranitomeya imitator.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about the evolution of prosocial behavior. We talk about\
  \ what prosocial behavior is, and how old it is in evolutionary history. We go through\
  \ affiliative behavior, pair bonding and parental care, and empathy. We discuss\
  \ how important it is to look beyond mammals, and the role of gene expression in\
  \ prosocial behavior. Finally, we talk about the extended evolutionary synthesis,\
  \ and how we should be wary of our own cultural biases when studying animal behavior.</p>\n"

summary: Dr. Jessica Nowicki is a Research Scientist at the Wu Tsai Neurosciences
  Institute at Stanford University. She is interested in the mechanistic basis of
  prosocial behavior in early vertebrates. She uses poison frogs, which display considerable
  variation in sociality among closely related species, for comparatively identifying
  neural correlates of pair bonding within the clade. In order to verify the functional
  involvement of these correlates, she then couples this with functional tests on
  the strongly pair bonding species, Ranitomeya imitator.
