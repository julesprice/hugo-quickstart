shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 5th 2023.  \nDr. Jessica Nowicki is a Research Scientist\
  \ at the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute at Stanford University. She is interested\
  \ in the mechanistic basis of prosocial behavior in early vertebrates. She uses\
  \ poison frogs, which display considerable variation in sociality among closely\
  \ related species, for comparatively identifying neural correlates of pair bonding\
  \ within the clade. In order to verify the functional involvement of these correlates,\
  \ she then couples this with functional tests on the strongly pair bonding species,\
  \ Ranitomeya imitator.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the evolution of prosocial\
  \ behavior. We talk about what prosocial behavior is, and how old it is in evolutionary\
  \ history. We go through affiliative behavior, pair bonding and parental care, and\
  \ empathy. We discuss how important it is to look beyond mammals, and the role of\
  \ gene expression in prosocial behavior. Finally, we talk about the extended evolutionary\
  \ synthesis, and how we should be wary of our own cultural biases when studying\
  \ animal behavior.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:35  What is prosocial behavior,\
