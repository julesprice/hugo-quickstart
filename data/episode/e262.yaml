  <p>In this episode, we talk about the psychology of music. We first go through how\
  \ music is a construct of our brains and its evolutionary bases. Then we discuss\
  \ if music is a human universal, and if anyone can learn music. We talk a bit about\
  \ the neuroscience of music, and catchy tunes and earworms. Finally, we cover some\
  \ aspects of music appreciation and the acquisition of musical tastes.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
