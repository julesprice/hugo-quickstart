shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 13th, 2020.  \nDr. Robert Kelly is Professor of Archaeology\
  \ at the University of Wyoming. Dr. Kelly has shaped and contributed much to our\
  \ understanding of hunter-gatherer societies. He has a deep interest in Western\
  \ North American archaeology, especially in the Great Basin area. Current understanding\
  \ of hunter-gatherer mobility and foraging patterns are also influenced strongly\
  \ by his research, fieldwork, and ethnology. By examining the Pleistocene colonization\
  \ of the Americas by examining artifacts and lithic technology, Dr. Kelly reconstructs\
  \ past life-ways and compares them to current foraging societies, and examines human\
  \ adaptation to climate change during different periods in the past. He\u2019s the\
  \ author of books like The Foraging Spectrum: Diversity in Hunter-Gatherer Lifeways,\
  \ and The Fifth Beginning: What Six Million Years of Human History Can Tell Us about\
  \ Our Future.\n\nIn this episode, we focus for the most part on Dr. Kelly\u2019\
  s book, The Fifth Beginning. But first we discuss the discipline of Archaeology\
  \ in its strengths and limitations. Then, we get into the meat of the book, and\
  \ talk about the first four beginnings: the beginning of technology; the beginning\
  \ of culture; the beginning of agriculture; the beginning of the State; and the\
  \ fifth beginning, which we are going through now, starting around 1500 CE. We also\
  \ tackle how we might get to solve current urgent global-scale problems, like climate\
  \ change. As a final topic, we explore issues surrounding hunter-gatherers, how\
  \ we think about them as a monolithic social entity, and we also refer to thinks\
  \ like variability, human universals, and evolutionary psychology and \u201Chuman\
  \ nature\u201D.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:14  The limitations of Archaeology as a science,\
