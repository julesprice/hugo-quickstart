shownotes: "<p>Dr. Colin F. Camerer is the Robert Kirby Professor of Behavioral Finance\
  \ and Economics at the California Institute of Technology, where he teaches cognitive\
  \ psychology and economics. His work seeks a better understanding of the psychological\
  \ and neurobiological basis of decision-making in order to determine the validity\
  \ of models of human economic behavior. His research uses mostly economics experiments\u2014\
  and occasionally field studies\u2014to understand how people behave when making\
  \ decisions (e.g., risky gambles for money), in games, and in markets (e.g., speculative\
  \ price bubbles). In 2013, Dr. Camerer was named a MacArthur Fellow.</p>\n<p>In\
  \ this episode, we focus on the modern science of economics, integrated with cognitive\
  \ and experimental psychology, and neuroscience. We first discuss the different\
  \ types of decision-making that we are cognitively endowed with. We address what\
  \ rationality is from an economics perspective. We talk about the importance of\
  \ collecting data from different sources to develop a full understanding of our\
  \ cognitive mechanisms, from psychology, economics, anthropology and neuroscience.\
  \ Then, we focus on the current state of the art in neuroscience, its limitations\
  \ as a discipline and at the level of its imaging techniques, and the knowledge\
  \ we can draw from it. We also refer to the limitations of lab experiments, and\
  \ how they can be complemented by field studies in natural settings. We also talk\
  \ about individualist vs collectivist approaches in economics; how to think about\
  \ social norms; and what are \u201Cbeliefs\u201D in economics. Finally, we discuss\
  \ the concept of \u201Crisk\u201D in economics, the factors behind risky gambling\
  \ in the stock market, and possible ways to prevent it.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Faculty\
