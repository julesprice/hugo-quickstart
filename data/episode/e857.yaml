shownotes: "<p>Dr. Amy Arnsten is Albert E. Kent Professor of Neuroscience and Professor\
  \ of Psychology, and member of the Kavli Institute of\nNeuroscience at Yale University.\
  \ Dr. Arnsten is an international expert on the molecular regulation of higher cortical\
  \ circuits, and a member of the National Academy of Medicine. Dr. Arnsten&#39;s\
  \ research examines the neural basis of higher cognition. Her work has revealed\
  \ that the newly evolved cortical circuits that underlie higher cognition are uniquely\
  \ regulated at the molecular level, conferring vulnerability in mental illness and\
  \ age-related cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer&#39;s Disease.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about the prefrontal cortex and the role it plays in\
  \ neurological and mental disorders. We start by talking about the organization\
  \ and functional properties of the prefrontal cortex. We discuss ADHD, conduct disorder,\
  \ and the neurological effects of\nlong-COVID. We get into the biochemical mechanisms\
  \ behind stress responses. We talk about PTSD, and how to treat it. We talk about\
  \ the neurological effects of chronic stress. We discuss why the prefrontal cortex\
  \ is so vulnerable to stress. We talk about targeting aging itself and the mechanisms\
  \ of aging to prevent neural disorders. Finally, we discuss how neuroscience can\
  \ help us become more compassionate.</p>\n"
