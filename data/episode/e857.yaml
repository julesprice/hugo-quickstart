  \ Arnsten is Albert E. Kent Professor of Neuroscience and Professor of Psychology,\
  \ and member of the Kavli Institute of Neuroscience at Yale University. Dr. Arnsten\
  \ is an international expert on the molecular regulation of higher cortical circuits,\
  \ and a member of the National Academy of Medicine. Dr. Arnsten's research examines\
  \ the neural basis of higher cognition. Her work has revealed that the newly evolved\
  \ cortical circuits that underlie higher cognition are uniquely regulated at the\
  \ molecular level, conferring vulnerability in mental illness and age-related cognitive\
  \ disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease. Her research has led to new treatments\
  \ for cognitive disorders in humans, including the successful translation of guanfacine\
  \ (IntunivTM) for the treatment of ADHD and related prefrontal cortical disorders.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about the prefrontal cortex and the role it plays in\
  \ neurological and mental disorders. We start by talking about the organization\
  \ and functional properties of the prefrontal cortex. We discuss ADHD, conduct disorder,\
  \ and the neurological effects of long COVID. We get into the biochemical mechanisms\
  \ behind stress responses. We talk about PTSD, and how to treat it. We talk about\
  \ the neurological effects of chronic stress. We discuss why the prefrontal cortex\
  \ is so vulnerable to stress. We talk about targeting aging itself and the mechanisms\
  \ of aging to prevent neural disorders. Finally, we discuss how neuroscience can\
  \ help us become more compassionate.\n\nTime Links:\n00:00  Intro\n01:10  The organization\
