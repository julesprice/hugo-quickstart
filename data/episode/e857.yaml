shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 27th 2023.  \nDr. Amy Arnsten is Albert E. Kent Professor\
  \ of Neuroscience and Professor of Psychology, and member of the Kavli Institute\
  \ of Neuroscience at Yale University. Dr. Arnsten is an international expert on\
  \ the molecular regulation of higher cortical circuits, and a member of the National\
  \ Academy of Medicine. Dr. Arnsten's research examines the neural basis of higher\
  \ cognition. Her work has revealed that the newly evolved cortical circuits that\
  \ underlie higher cognition are uniquely regulated at the molecular level, conferring\
  \ vulnerability in mental illness and age-related cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's\
  \ Disease. Her research has led to new treatments for cognitive disorders in humans,\
  \ including the successful translation of guanfacine (IntunivTM) for the treatment\
  \ of ADHD and related prefrontal cortical disorders.\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about the prefrontal cortex and the role it plays in neurological and mental disorders.\
  \ We start by talking about the organization and functional properties of the prefrontal\
  \ cortex. We discuss ADHD, conduct disorder, and the neurological effects of long\
  \ COVID. We get into the biochemical mechanisms behind stress responses. We talk\
  \ about PTSD, and how to treat it. We talk about the neurological effects of chronic\
  \ stress. We discuss why the prefrontal cortex is so vulnerable to stress. We talk\
  \ about targeting aging itself and the mechanisms of aging to prevent neural disorders.\
  \ Finally, we discuss how neuroscience can help us become more compassionate.\n\n\
