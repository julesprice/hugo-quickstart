  \ at McGill University, and Research Associate in the Department of Psychiatry at\
  \ Sir Mortimer B. Davis-Jewish General Hospital. His research interests include\
  \ developmental factors in personality disorders (especially borderline personality),\

  \ Evidence-Based Critique of Contemporary Psychoanalysis, The Fall of an Icon: Psychoanalysis\
  \ and Academic Psychiatry, and Fads and Fallacies in Psychiatry.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we focus on psychoanalysis. We start with a history of psychoanalysis,\
  \ and its theoretical bases. We talk about the importance of taking individual differences\
  \ into account when studying human psychology. The clinical aspect of psychoanalysis,\
  \ and comparing it to cognitive-behavioral therapy. We discuss what psychoanalysis\
  \ gets wrong about the subconscious mind, repressed memories, and defense mechanisms.\
  \ We talk about how psychoanalysts have been trying to force neuroscience into their\
  \ preconceived theories. We address some of the most pressing issues in modern psychiatry.\
  \ We finish by asking if it is possible to reconcile psychoanalysis with modern\
  \ scientific psychology.</p>\n"
