  \ University, and a Laureate Professor at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and\
  \ Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne. He specializes in applied ethics\
  \ and approaches ethical issues from a secular, utilitarian perspective. He is known\
  \ in particular for his book Animal Liberation (1975), in which he argues in favor\
  \ of veganism, and his essay \"Famine, Affluence, and Morality\", in which he argues\
  \ in favor of donating to help the global poor. He has written, co-authored, edited\
  \ or co-edited more than 50 books, including Practical Ethics, The Expanding Circle,\

  \ and The Point of View of the Universe (with Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek). His writings\
  \ have appeared in more than 25 languages.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we first get\
  \ into how we morality can be objective, and issues regarding our evolved morality\
  \ and its conflicting features, the limitations of reason, and if it is possible\
  \ to derive moral values from science. We talk about how personality might influence\
  \ the philosophies that people develop, and if it would be acceptable to nudge people\u2019\
  s behavior through environmental tweaks. We then discuss effective altruism and\
  \ its several flavors, and if we should eliminate all suffering. In the latter part\
  \ of the interview, we talk about some specific subjects, like veganism, human enhancement,\
  \ and euthanasia. Toward the end, we also discuss moral foundations theory, and\
  \ if it should influence the way people do moral philosophy.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow\
