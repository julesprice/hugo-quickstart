shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 19th 2021.  \nDr. Arvid \xC5gren is Wenner-Gren Fellow\
  \ in the Department of Evolutionary Biology at Uppsala University. He is an evolutionary\
  \ biologist studying genomic conflicts. He is the author of The Gene's-Eye View\
  \ of Evolution.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Gene's-Eye View of Evolution.\
  \ We first introduce the idea, and walk-through concepts like the \u201Cselfish\
  \ gene\u201D, and the replicator-vehicle approach. We get into the debate surrounding\
  \ levels of selection, and inclusive fitness theory and group selection. We talk\
  \ about what evolutionary biologists think about the gene\u2019s-eye view of evolution,\
  \ and the best alternatives to it. We discuss the relationship between this perspective\
  \ and adaptationism, and how it makes sense of phenomena like pleiotropy, polygeny,\
  \ and sexual selection. We discuss some limitations of it when dealing with developmental\
  \ biology. We talk about cultural selection, and if memetics has been successful\
  \ as a scientific discipline. Finally, we talk about what the gene\u2019s-eye view\
  \ of evolution might have to say about human nature, and the moral nature of the\
  \ Universe.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:30  What is the gene\u2019s-eye\
