  \ the University of British Columbia, Canada. He is a social psychologist whose\

  <p>In this episode, we talk about the science of religion, and the ethics of self-driving\
  \ cars. First, we refer to the role that the science of religion plays in the integration\
  \ of the Humanities and the Sciences. Then, we address the prosocial and moral aspects\
  \ of religion, starting with the role that Big Gods played in allowing for cohesion\
  \ in large societies, and also the traits that work better in them. Also, why it\
  \ is more difficult to explain religious misbelief than religious thinking. Finally,\
  \ we discuss the ethics of self-driving cars, what people prefer to be their decisions,\
  \ and what the future might hold for this technology.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow\
