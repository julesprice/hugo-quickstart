  <p>In this episode, we talk about musicology. We start with the evolution of music,
  and how it relates to language and bird song. We discuss the (social) functions
  of music. We get into the cultural evolution of music, and cross-cultural regularities.
  We ask if music is a uniquely human phenomenon, and if we can learn more about biological
  and cultural diversity by studying musical evolution. We talk about music copyright
  laws. Finally, we address the main challenges of cross-cultural work in music cognition,
  and talk about underexplored questions in musicology.</p>
