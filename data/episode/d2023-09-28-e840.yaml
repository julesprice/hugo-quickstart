shownotes: "<p>Dr. Alicia Juarrero is President and Founder of VectorAnalytica. Her\
  \ research in neurophilosophy has been focused on the causal role of context-sensitive\
  \ constraints in the emergence of mental events such as intentions. She is the author\
  \ of several books, the most recent one being Context Changes Everything: How Constraints\
  \ Create Coherence.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Context Changes\
  \ Everything. We start by discussing the problem of identity, how change is compatible\
  \ with remaining the same, and why Western science and philosophy cannot deal with\
  \ the relations between parts and wholes. We talk about coherence, the problem of\
  \ causation, and Aristotle\u2019s four causes. We discuss what constraints are,\
  \ and talk about context-independent and context-dependent constraints, and how\
  \ they apply to the study of infectious diseases. We talk about identity theory,\
  \ and multiple realizability in neuroscience. Finally, we discuss 4E cognition,\
  \ and how intentions, thoughts, and beliefs can cause anything.</p>\n"
