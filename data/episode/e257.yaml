shownotes: "<p>Dr. Tania Reynolds is a Social Psychology postdoctoral researcher at\
  \ the Kinsey Institute. She received her PhD in Social Psychology from Florida State\
  \ University under Dr. Roy Baumeister and Dr. Jon Maner. Her research examines how\
  \ pressure to compete for social and romantic partners asymmetrically affects the\
  \ competitive behaviors and well-being of men and women. Through a joint appointment\
  \ with the Gender Studies department, Dr. Reynolds offers courses on human sexuality\
  \ and sex/gender differences. As a collaborative research team with Justin Garcia\
  \ and Amanda Gesselman, she hopes to examine the dispositional predictors and physiological\
  \ correlates of individuals\u2019 romantic relationship experiences, as well as\
  \ how these associations may differ across gender and sexual orientation.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we go through several topics of Dr. Reynolds\u2019 research.\
  \ We first talk about how men and women\u2019s mate preferences influence their\
  \ intrasexual and intersexual social dynamics. We also refer to friendships, focusing\
  \ more on same-sex friendships. We discuss a paper about human patrilocality and\
  \ how woman needed to establish same-sex friendships with non-kin women during our\
  \ evolution, and how self-deception might have played a role in intrasexual competition.\
  \ We talk about sexual economics theory applied to mating contests, and also how\
  \ men use romantic partners as social signals to other men. We also discuss a little\
  \ bit the evolution of personality traits, before getting into gender bias in moral\
  \ typecasting. Finally, we explore the topic of the problems in the workplace and\
  \ science production that might stem from a culture of victim sanctification and\
  \ harm-avoidance.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Reynolds\u2019 work:</p>\n<p>Webpage\
