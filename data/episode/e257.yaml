shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 23rd, 2019.  \nDr. Tania Reynolds is a Social Psychology\
  \ postdoctoral researcher at the Kinsey Institute. She received her PhD in Social\
  \ Psychology from Florida State University under Dr. Roy Baumeister and Dr. Jon\
  \ Maner. Her research examines how pressure to compete for social and romantic partners\
  \ asymmetrically affects the competitive behaviors and well-being of men and women.\
  \ Through a joint appointment with the Gender Studies department, Dr. Reynolds offers\
  \ courses on human sexuality and sex/gender differences. As a collaborative research\
  \ team with Justin Garcia and Amanda Gesselman, she hopes to examine the dispositional\
  \ predictors and physiological correlates of individuals\u2019 romantic relationship\
  \ experiences, as well as how these associations may differ across gender and sexual\
  \ orientation.\n\nIn this episode, we go through several topics of Dr. Reynolds\u2019\
  \ research. We first talk about how men and women\u2019s mate preferences influence\
  \ their intrasexual and intersexual social dynamics. We also refer to friendships,\
  \ focusing more on same-sex friendships. We discuss a paper about human patrilocality\
  \ and how women needed to establish same-sex friendships with non-kin women during\
  \ our evolution, and how self-deception might have played a role in intrasexual\
  \ competition. We talk about sexual economics theory applied to mating contests,\
  \ and also how men use romantic partners as social signals to other men. We also\
  \ discuss a little bit the evolution of personality traits, before getting into\
  \ gender bias in moral typecasting. Finally, we explore the topic of the problems\
  \ in the workplace and science production that might stem from a culture of victim\
  \ sanctification and harm-avoidance.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:27  Going from mate preferences\
