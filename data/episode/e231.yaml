shownotes: "<p>Dr. Carlton Patrick is Assistant Professor of Legal Studies at the\
  \ College of Community, Innovation and Education at the University of Central Florida.\
  \ Dr. Patrick studies the psychology of legal decision-making, often from an evolutionary\
  \ perspective. His research combines doctrinal legal analysis with the methodologies\
  \ and perspectives of the behavioral sciences to examine the roots of human behavior\
  \ in legally-relevant contexts. He is the coauthor, together with Debra Lieberman,\
  \ of the book Objection: Disgust, Morality, and the Law.</p>\n<p>This is the second\
  \ episode where I talk about the book Objection: Disgust Morality, and the Law.\
  \ The first one was with the other coauthor, Dr. Debra Lieberman (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7KCXBPvRlg\"\
  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7KCXBPvRlg</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we talk about the legal aspects of the book. First, Dr. Patrick tells us about\
  \ his take of the evolved domains of disgust \u2013 pathogen, sexual, and moral.\
  \ We then talk about how we formulate laws based on disgust, or how we go from \u201C\
  gross\u201D to \u201Cwrong\u201D. We also discuss the important distinction between\
  \ laws and social norms. We get into the very contentious discussion about if legal\
  \ systems are moral. Dr. Patrick gives a few examples of legal areas that are influenced\
  \ by disgust, like obscenity and sexual relationships. We finally explore if disgust\
  \ should be used as a criterion to create laws, and also if jurors and judges should\
  \ be exposed to evidential material that triggers disgust.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
