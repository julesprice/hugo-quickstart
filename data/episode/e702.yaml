  <p>In this episode, we talk about skill and knowledge acquisition, and trust-based
  interactions. We start by talking about the acquisition of skill, knowledge, and
  material production across the lifespan in foraging societies. We also discuss ethnobiological
  knowledge, sex differences in knowledge acquisition and specialization, and storytelling
  skills. We then get into how human relationships are maintained, with a focus on
  trust. We discuss how promises, apologies, and confessions build and rebuild trust.
  We talk about dishonesty and mistrust, and gender stereotypes associated with them.
  We talk about trust games, and what we can learn from them. Finally, we discuss
  the role that risk plays in the evolution of human exchange.</p>
