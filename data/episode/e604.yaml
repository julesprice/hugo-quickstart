shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 13th 2021.  \nDr. George Sher is Herbert S. Autrey\
  \ Professor of Humanities and Professor of Philosophy at Rice University. In recent\
  \ years, his research has centered on two main topics: responsibility and distributive\
  \ justice. He is the author of several books, the most recent one being A Wild West\
  \ of the Mind.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on A Wild West of the Mind. We start\
  \ with the premise of the book, and then go through topics like the psychological\
  \ effects of \u201Cbad\u201D thoughts, and linking thoughts to actions; character\
  \ flaws; the problem with sharing nasty thoughts with other people; a thought experiment\
  \ on having direct access to other people\u2019s minds; how much control we really\
  \ have over our thoughts; and the benefits of having mental freedom.\n\nTime Links:\
