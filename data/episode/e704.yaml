shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 26th 2022.  \nDr. Matthew Cobb is a Professor in the\
  \ School of Biological Sciences at the University of Manchester, where his research\
  \ focuses on the sense of smell, insect behavior and the history of science. He\
  \ is also a historian of the French Resistance. He\u2019s the author of several\
  \ books, including As Gods: A Moral History of the Genetic Age.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on As Gods. We first talk about the history of humans altering genomes,\
  \ and the advent of genetic engineering. We discuss why geneticists paused their\
  \ work in the 1970s, and new protocols in laboratory research. We go through different\
  \ types of technology, like genetically modified organisms (GMOs), gene therapy,\
  \ and gene drives. We talk about another pause in 2012, and a development in 2019.\
  \ Finally, we discuss how the press communicates about genetic engineering.\n\n\
