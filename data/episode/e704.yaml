  \ talk about the history of humans altering genomes, and the advent of genetic engineering.\
  \ We discuss why geneticists paused their work in the 1970s, and new protocols in\
  \ laboratory research. We go through different types of technology, like genetically\
  \ modified organisms (GMOs), gene therapy, and gene drives. We talk about another\
  \ pause in 2012, and a development in 2019. Finally, we discuss how the press communicates\
  \ about genetic engineering.</p>\n"
