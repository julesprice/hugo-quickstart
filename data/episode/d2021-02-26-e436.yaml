  <p>In this episode, we focus on the two books: Just Deserts, and Rejecting Retributivism.
  First, we give an overview of the philosophical positions on free will, with a focus
  on incompatibilism, and we talk about luck. We discuss degrees of free will. We
  then talk about the link between free will and morality; praise and blame; if people
  need to believe in free will to be moral; how our legal and penal systems work,
  and how they should change; if we need to punish wrongdoers. Finally, we go through
  a lengthy discussion about how a new system could replace the penal systems based
  on retributivism, and we ask if we should nudge people.</p>
