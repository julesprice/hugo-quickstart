  \ His research interests include Evolutionary psychology, Comparative psychology/Ethology,\
  \ Primatology, Aesthetics, Psychology of religion, and History of psychology. He\
  \ is the author of 13 scientific books, including The Aesthetic Animal.</p>\n<p>In\
  \ this episode, we focus on The Aesthetic Animal. We talk about the aesthetic impulse,\
  \ and the evolution of art and aesthetic appreciation. We also discuss individual\
  \ differences in art appreciation. We go through the evolution and social functions\
  \ of body ornamentation, song, dance, music, and fiction. We talk a bit about the\
  \ neuroscience of aesthetics, and the role existential uncertainty might play in\
  \ art production. Finally, we talk about how we can improve human wellbeing by learning\
  \ more about our \u201Caesthetic impulse\u201D, mostly through architecture.</p>\n"
