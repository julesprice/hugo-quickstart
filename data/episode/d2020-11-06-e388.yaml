shownotes: "<p>Dr. Warren Brown is Director of the Lee Edwards Travis Research Institute\
  \ and Professor of Psychology in the Department of Doctoral Psychology at Fuller\
  \ Theological Seminary. Currently, he is most actively involved in neuroscience\
  \ research in two areas: (1) the cognitive and psychosocial disabilities in a congenital\
  \ brain malformation called agenesis of the corpus callosum, and (2) the consequences\
  \ in adults of a childhood hemispherectomy for the control of seizures. Brown has\
  \ also studied functioning of the corpus callosum in dyslexia, Attention Deficit\
  \ Hyperactivity Disorder, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and\
  \ he has done research on brain wave changes associated with aging and dementia,\
  \ language comprehension, dialysis treatment for kidney disease, and attention deficits\
  \ in schizophrenia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this episode, we tackle some major theoretical\
  \ questions in neuroscience. We discuss mind-brain dualism, reductionism and emergentism,\
  \ embodied cognition, causality, and determinism and free will. We also talk about\
  \ Dr. Brown\u2019s research on the agenesis of the corpus calossum, the neuroscience\
  \ of religion, and the relationship between science and religion.</p>\n"
