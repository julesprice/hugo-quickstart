shownotes: "<p>Dr. Holger Wiese is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology\
  \ at Durham University, where he runs an EEG lab. He is mainly interested in face\
  \ recognition and face perception. He investigates how we recognize familiar faces,\
  \ how we learn new facial identities, why people are more accurate at remembering\
  \ faces of their own ethnic and age groups, how we perceive age, sex, and attractiveness\
  \ in unfamiliar faces, and how our knowledge about other people is structured in\
  \ semantic memory. He is also interested in how these aspects of face and person\
  \ perception change across the adult lifespan.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk\
  \ about face recognition. We first refer to its possible function(s), and how it\
  \ is processed in the brain. We discuss what information people get from faces,\
  \ and the phenomena of face familiarity and what makes faces distinctive. We also\
  \ refer to biases in face recognition, and if they can me modified. Other topics\
  \ include: cognitive ageing and difficulties in face recognition; the relationship\
  \ between semantic memory and face memory; male and female faces; and facial attractiveness.</p>\n\
