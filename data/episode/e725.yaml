shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 12th 2022.  \nDr. Sarah Mathew is Associate Professor\
  \ in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State University.\
  \ She studies the evolution of human ultra-sociality and the role of culture in\
  \ enabling it. She is especially interested in how humans evolved the capacity to\
  \ cooperate with millions of genetically unrelated individuals, and how this links\
  \ to the origins of moral sentiments, prosocial behavior, norms, and large-scale\
  \ warfare. To address these issues, she directs a theoretically-informed field research\
  \ program among the Turkana, a subsistence pastoral society in Kenya who cooperate\
  \ at a large scale, including in lethal interethnic raids, without formal centralized\
  \ political institutions.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the evolution of human\
  \ sociality. We start by talking about how human sociality differs from the sociality\
  \ of other closely-related species, and what enables it. We get into perception\
  \ errors, what they are, and how they impact reciprocity. We discuss how humans\
  \ cooperate with an immense number of genetically unrelated individuals. We talk\
  \ about what leads to warfare, and the phenomenon of moral injury and how it relates\
  \ to PTSD. Finally, we talk about the role of culture in facilitating small-scale\
  \ cooperation.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:46  How human sociality differs\
