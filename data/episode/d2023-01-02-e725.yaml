shownotes: '<p>Dr. Sarah Mathew is Associate Professor in the School of Human Evolution
  and Social Change at Arizona State University. She studies the evolution of human
  ultra-sociality and the role of culture in enabling it. She is especially interested
  in how humans evolved the capacity to cooperate with millions of genetically unrelated
  individuals, and how this links to the origins of moral sentiments, prosocial behavior,
  norms, and large-scale warfare.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about the evolution of human sociality. We start by
  talking about how human sociality differs from the sociality of other closely-related
  species, and what enables it. We get into perception errors, what they are, and
  how they impact reciprocity. We discuss how humans cooperate with an immense number
  of genetically unrelated individuals. We talk about what leads to warfare, and the
  phenomenon of moral injury and how it relates to PTSD. Finally, we talk about the
  role of culture in facilitating small-scale cooperation.</p>
