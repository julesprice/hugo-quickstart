shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 17th 2021.  \nDr. Stephen Fleming is Wellcome Trust/Royal\
  \ Society Sir Henry Dale Fellow at the Department of Experimental Psychology and\
  \ Principal Investigator at the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging where he\
  \ leads the Metacognition Group, at University College London. The question that\
  \ drives most his research is: what supports the remarkable capacity for human self-awareness?\
  \ To address this question, he combines experimental and theoretical approaches\
  \ (psychophysics, computational modelling, neuroimaging) to understand how people\
  \ become self-aware of aspects of their cognition and behavior (such as perception,\
  \ memory and decision-making), and why such awareness is often impaired in psychiatric\
  \ and neurological disorders. Current interests focus on understanding contributions\
  \ of human prefrontal cortex to metacognition, and how self-awareness and social\
  \ cognition may share a core neurocomputational basis. He is the author of Know\
  \ Thyself: The New Science of Self-Awareness.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Know\
  \ Thyself. We start by discussing what self-awareness is, its components, and the\
  \ sorts of mental tasks associated with it. We discuss the evolutionary rationale\
  \ for it. We talk about individual differences in self-awareness, and ask if it\
  \ is possible to improve it. We discuss how self-awareness might interfere with\
  \ performance, and if experts are good at explaining how they do things. We talk\
  \ about how knowledge about metacognition might improve learning and decision-making.\
  \ We discuss how a lack of metacognition correlates with more extreme political\
  \ attitudes. We talk about how self-awareness can promote social cooperation. Finally,\
  \ we discuss if we should delegate decisions to AI systems, their limitations, and\
  \ if they could become self-aware.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:40  What\
