shownotes: '<p>Dr. Stephen Fleming is Wellcome Trust/Royal Society Sir Henry Dale
  Fellow at the Department of Experimental Psychology and Principal Investigator at
  the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging where he leads the Metacognition Group,
  at University College London. The question that drives most his research is: what
  supports the remarkable capacity for human self-awareness? He is the author of Know
  Thyself: The New Science of Self-Awareness.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on Know Thyself. We start by discussing what self-awareness
  is, its components, and the sorts of mental tasks associated with it. We discuss
  the evolutionary rationale for it. We talk about individual differences in self-awareness,
  and ask if it is possible to improve it. We discuss how self-awareness might interfere
  with performance, and if experts are good at explaining how they do things. We talk
  about how knowledge about metacognition might improve learning and decision-making.
  We discuss how a lack of metacognition correlates with more extreme political attitudes.
  We talk about how self-awareness can promote social cooperation. Finally, we discuss
  if we should delegate decisions to AI systems, their limitations, and if they could
  become self-aware.</p>
