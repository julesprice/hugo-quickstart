shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 3rd, 2020.  \nDr. Alberto Acerbi is a Lecturer in Psychology\
  \ in the Centre for Culture and Evolution at Brunel University London. He is a cognitive/evolutionary\
  \ anthropologist with a particular interest in computational science. The main question\
  \ that drives his research is: is it possible to find some general factors determining\
  \ why some cultural traits succeed and others do not? He is interested in particular\
  \ in contemporary cultural phenomena, and he uses a naturalistic, quantitative,\
  \ and evolutionary approach with different methodologies, especially individual-based\
  \ models and quantitative analysis of large-scale data. He published a book recently,\
  \ Cultural Evolution in the Digital Age.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Dr. Acerbi\u2019\
  s book, and go through some of its main topics, like the impact of new technologies\
  \ on cultural evolution; the similarities and differences between online activity\
  \ and real life; the impact of celebrities and online influencers; echo chambers\
  \ and political polarization; post-truth; and the opacity of online algorithms.\
  \ Toward the end, we also discuss theories in cultural evolution.\n\nTime Links:\

  \ in real life by studying online phenomena?  \n16:56  Can these technologies impact\
  \ the evolution of our cognition?  \n19:53  People are not gullible  \n24:43  The\
  \ real impact of celebrities and online influencers  \n27:29  People are not that\
  \ mean on the internet  \n29:44  About echo chambers and political polarization\
  \  \n35:52  Are we really living in a post-truth era?  \n38:26  Do we have to worry\
