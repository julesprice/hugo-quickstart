  \ we focus on Scale. We talk about the study of scaling, and what we can learn from\
  \ it. We talk about regularities (scaling laws), but also different constraints\
  \ across different scales. We focus a lot on biological systems, and talk about\
  \ metabolic rates, growth, longevity, and aging and death. We discuss if and how\
  \ we could extend our lifespans. We also discuss why we need a science of cities\
  \ and urbanization, with the future of humanity and the planet in mind.</p>\n"
