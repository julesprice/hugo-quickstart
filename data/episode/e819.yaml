shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 17th 2023.  \nDr. Geoffrey West is Shannan Distinguished\
  \ Professor at the Santa Fe Institute. He is a theoretical physicist whose primary\
  \ interests have been in fundamental questions in physics, especially those concerning\
  \ the elementary particles, their interactions and cosmological implications. His\
  \ long-term fascination in general scaling phenomena evolved into a highly productive\
  \ collaboration on the origin of universal scaling laws that pervade biology from\
  \ the molecular genomic scale up through mitochondria and cells to whole organisms\
  \ and ecosystems. He is the author of several books, including Scale: The Universal\
  \ Laws of Life, Growth, and Death in Organisms, Cities, and Companies.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on Scale. We talk about the study of scaling, and what we can\
  \ learn from it. We talk about regularities (scaling laws), but also different constraints\
  \ across different scales. We focus a lot on biological systems, and talk about\
  \ metabolic rates, growth, longevity, and aging and death. We discuss if and how\
  \ we could extend our lifespans. We also discuss why we need a science of cities\
  \ and urbanization, with the future of humanity and the planet in mind.\n\nTime\
