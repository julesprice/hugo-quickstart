shownotes: "<p>Dr. Joseph Errington is Professor of Anthropology at Yale University.\
  \ He studies language change as a source of insight into the ways languages constitute\
  \ intimate parts of our everyday lives, and at the same time are foundational for\
  \ large-scale institutions, social groups, and social dynamics. He has worked mostly\
  \ in Indonesia, studying Javanese (90 million speakers), Indonesian (250 million\
  \ speakers) and a range of Malay dialects. He has also worked on questions of language\
  \ ideology and practice: how conceptions of language can shape and reflect social\
  \ interests, naturalize images of social groups, and shape everyday ways of talking.</p>\n\
  <p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about some topics in linguistics. We discuss\
  \ language ideologies. We talk about the history of linguistics, and its ties to\
  \ colonialism, including the invention of hierarchies of languages; stripping languages\
  \ of their sociocultural context, and issues with the Universal Grammar approach;\
  \ imposing written forms on languages; reducing languages to the versions used by\
  \ social elites; and the invention of national languages. We also discuss misconceptions\
  \ about non-standard versions of languages; threats to marginalized languages and\
  \ their communities; and how these issues manifest in the Javanese and the Indonesian\
  \ language.</p>\n"
