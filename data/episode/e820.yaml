shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 18th 2023.  \nDr. Joseph Errington is Professor of Anthropology\
  \ at Yale University. He studies language change as a source of insight into the\
  \ ways languages constitute intimate parts of our everyday lives, and at the same\
  \ time are foundational for large-scale institutions, social groups, and social\
  \ dynamics. He has worked mostly in Indonesia, studying Javanese (90 million speakers),\
  \ Indonesian (250 million speakers) and a range of Malay dialects. He has also worked\
  \ on questions of language ideology and practice: how conceptions of language can\
  \ shape and reflect social interests, naturalize images of social groups, and shape\
  \ everyday ways of talking. He is the author of books like Language and Social Change\
  \ in Java, Shifting Languages, and Linguistics in a Colonial World.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about some topics in linguistics. We discuss language ideologies. We talk\
  \ about the history of linguistics, and its ties to colonialism, including the invention\
  \ of hierarchies of languages; stripping languages off their sociocultural context,\
  \ and issues with the Universal Grammar approach; imposing written forms on languages;\
  \ reducing languages to the versions used by social elites; and the invention of\
  \ national languages. We also discuss misconceptions about non-standard versions\
  \ of languages; threats to marginalized languages and their communities; and how\
  \ these issues manifest on the Javanese and the Indonesian language.\n\nTime Links:\
