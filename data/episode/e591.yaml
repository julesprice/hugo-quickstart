shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 12th 2021.  \nDr. John Petrocelli is Professor of\
  \ Psychology at Wake Forest University. He is a social psychologist and his research\
  \ involves experimental social cognition and judgment and decision making.  His\
  \ specific research interests include attitude strength and persuasion, bullshitting,\
  \ counterfactual thinking and metacognition. He is the author of The Life-Changing\

  \ Science of Detecting Bullshit. We define bullshit, and discuss the motivations\
  \ behind bullshitting, and the social contexts that promote it. We talk about the\
  \ costs of bullshit, individual differences in proneness and susceptibility to bullshitting.\
  \ We discuss how we can determine that something is bullshit, and signs of it. We\
  \ go into the tactics employed by bullshit artists. We discuss why TED Talks might\
  \ be problematic, and help disseminate bullshit. Finally, we discuss how we can\
  \ prevent bullshit from spreading.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:34  What\
