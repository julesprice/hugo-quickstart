shownotes: '<p>In this episode, we tackle lots of approaches, challenges and arguments
  in (meta)ethics. We basically go through some of the biggest questions that ethics
  and moral philosophy try to answer. We deal with the relationship between science
  and ethics, and the is-ought gap. We discuss intuitionism, moral realism, evolutionary
  psychology and moral relativism, and moral nihilism. We address the recent literature
  on human rationality. We talk about the anti-rationalist and the emotionist challenge.
  We touch on Moral Foundations Theory, and the implications it might have for ethics
  and moral philosophy. We get into the argument from agreement and the argument from
  disagreement, and the challenges they pose to moral realism. We also talk about
  the educated intuitions account of morality. Finally, we discuss if moral progress
  really exists.</p>
