  <p>In this episode, we talk about some general topics in evolutionary biology. We\
  \ first discuss the basic ingredients we need to have evolution by natural selection,\
  \ and the mechanisms associated with it. We refer to some of the issues about the\
  \ \u201Cextended evolutionary synthesis\u201D, as proposed by some biologists. We\
  \ then talk about the interplay between culture and biology in humans, and why human\
  \ behavior is more complex than the behavior of other species. We also discuss the\
  \ issues surrounding the concept of \u201Crace\u201D, and how to properly think\
  \ about human variation. Finally, we talk about how we can know that a trait is\
  \ an adaptation in evolutionary biology.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Vos\u2019\
