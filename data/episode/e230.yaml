shownotes: "Dr. Rutger Vos is an evolutionary biologist from Leiden University and\
  \ the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, both in The Netherlands. He does work in computational\
  \ biology and contributes to various open source software projects.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about some general topics in evolutionary biology. We first discuss the\
  \ basic ingredients we need to have evolution by natural selection, and the mechanisms\
  \ associated with it. We refer to some of the issues about the \u201Cextended evolutionary\
  \ synthesis\u201D, as proposed by some biologists. We then talk about the interplay\
  \ between culture and biology in humans, and why human behavior is more complex\
  \ than the behavior of other species. We also discuss the issues surrounding the\
  \ concept of \u201Crace\u201D, and how to properly think about human variation.\
  \ Finally, we talk about how we can know that a trait is an adaptation in evolutionary\
  \ biology.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:14  What do we need to have evolution by natural\
