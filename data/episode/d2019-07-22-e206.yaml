shownotes: "<p>Dr. Derek Leben is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University\
  \ of Pittsburgh, Johnstown. He works at the intersection of ethics, cognitive science,\
  \ and emerging technologies. In his new book, Ethics for Robots, Dr. Leben argues\
  \ for the use of a particular moral framework for designing autonomous systems based\
  \ on the Contractarianism of John Rawls. He also demonstrates how this framework\
  \ can be productively applied to autonomous vehicles, medical technologies, and\
  \ weapons systems.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on the main topics of Dr. Leben\u2019\
  s Ethics for Robots. We first discuss the types of robots that need to have ethical\
  \ systems programmed into them. Then, we get into the issue of how to establish\
  \ an objective moral system. Dr. Leben explains Contractarianism ethics. We also\
  \ go over some specific technologies, like self-driving cars, carebots, police-bots,\
  \ and others, and we refer to specific issues like discrimination and consent. Finally,\
  \ we talk about the role of science fiction in providing us with thought experiments\
  \ about emergent and future technology, and to what extent that has a positive or\
  \ a negative effect.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Leben\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty\
