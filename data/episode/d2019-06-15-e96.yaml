  \ Her research interests are within Childhood Studies, especially the history and\

  \ we talk about what might be some cultural influences on childhood, and how boys\
  \ and girls behave. We address the issue about how parents might look at their children\
  \ as economic assets, and how that influences division of labor between the sexes,\
  \ and child labor. We finish by talking a little bit about how people\u2019s perceptions\
  \ about children changed over time in the West, and some of the reason behind that\
  \ change.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:45 Do children share traits across different\
