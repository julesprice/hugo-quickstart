shownotes: "<p>Dr. Jonathan Maynard is a Lecturer in International Politics at King&#39;s\
  \ College London&#39;s Department of Political Economy. His research is primarily\
  \ concerned with the role of ideology in collective political violence, especially\
  \ in forms of violence against civilians such as genocides, mass atrocities and\
  \ terrorism. He is the author of Ideology and Mass Killing: The Radicalized Security\
  \ Politics of Genocides and Deadly Atrocities.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus\
  \ on Ideology and Mass Killing. We first define mass killings, and get into explanations\
  \ presented on the media; what ideology is; how ideologies can influence political\
  \ behavior; non-ideological explanations; and Dr. Maynard\u2019s neo-ideological\
  \ explanation. We discuss the \u201Ctrue believers\u201D, and how non-believers\
  \ can still be influenced; why mass killings take different forms; why they occur;\
  \ the role played by ideological propaganda and hate speech; if threats are ever\
  \ real; and if it is possible to predict and prevent mass killings.</p>\n"
