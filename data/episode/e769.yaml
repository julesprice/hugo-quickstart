shownotes: "<p>Dr. Eric Schwitzgebel is Professor of Philosophy at the University\
  \ of California, Riverside. Most of Dr. Schwitzgebel\u2019s research explores connections\
  \ between empirical psychology and philosophy of mind, especially the nature of\
  \ belief, the inaccuracy of our judgments about our stream of conscious experience,\
  \ and the tenuous relationship between philosophical ethics and actual moral behavior.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about beliefs, ethics, and psychology. We start by defining\
  \ belief. We discuss if we have accurate views of our own beliefs, and if beliefs\
  \ cause behavior. We talk about how well we really know our own conscious experience,\
  \ and discuss if introspection is reliable. We then discuss if ethics professors\
  \ and more moral than other people, if philosophy classes have any effect on the\
  \ moral behavior of students, and the effects of narrative arguments. We also discuss\
  \ if philosophy has become more welcoming of women in recent decades, and the relationship\
  \ between empirical psychology and philosophy.</p>\n"
