shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 12th 2022.  \nDr. Justin Gregg is a Senior Research\
  \ Associate with the Dolphin Communication Project and an Adjunct Professor at St.\
  \ Francis Xavier University, where he lectures on animal behavior and cognition.\
  \ Originally from Vermont, Dr. Gregg studied the echolocation abilities of wild\
  \ dolphins in Japan and the Bahamas. He is the author of If Nietzsche Were a Narwhal:\
  \ What Animal Intelligence Reveals About Human Stupidity.\n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ focus on If Nietzsche Were a Narwhal. We first talk about Nietzsche\u2019s thoughts\
  \ on other animals. We go through several aspects of animal psychology, including\
  \ intelligence, an understanding of causality, deception and lying, an understanding\
  \ of death and time, norms and morality, consciousness and self-awareness, and prognostic\
  \ myopia, and we talk about some of their drawbacks. We ask if there is a relationship\
  \ between biological complexity and evolutionary success. We talk about what is\
  \ psychologically unique in humans. Finally, we discuss if the planet is better\
  \ off with us, and the goal of the book.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:35\
