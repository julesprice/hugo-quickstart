shownotes: "<p>Dr. Timothy Lenton is Professor of Climate Change and Earth System\
  \ Science at the University of Exeter and Director of the Global Systems Institute.\
  \ He has over 20 years of research experience in studying the Earth as a system,\
  \ and developing and using models to understand its behavior. He is particularly\
  \ interested in how life has reshaped the planet in the past, and what lessons we\
  \ can draw from this as we proceed to reshape the planet now. These topics are covered\
  \ in his books \u2018Earth System Science: A Very Short Introduction\u2019 (OUP,\
  \ 2016) and (with Andrew Watson) \u2019Revolutions that Made the Earth\u2019 (OUP,\
  \ 2011).</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about Revolutions that Made the Earth.\
  \ We go through topics like: the intimate relationship between geology and life;\
  \ the origins of life (in hydrothermal vents); what Dr. Lenton, in the book, calls\
  \ the \u201Ccritical steps\u201D model of life; multicellular and complex life;\
  \ the evolution of social life; culture; what is special about humans; the development\
  \ of agriculture, and its impact on the planet; the Anthropocene, and when it started;\
  \ new revolutions in the future; and if life on Earth was inevitable.</p>\n"
