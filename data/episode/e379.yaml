shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 26th 2020.  \nDr. Paul Eastwick is Professor of Psychology\
  \ at the University of California, Davis. Dr. Eastwick\u2019s research investigates\
  \ how people initiate romantic relationships and the psychological mechanisms that\
  \ help romantic partners to remain committed and attached. One of his research programs\
  \ examines how the qualities that people say are critically important to them in\
  \ a romantic partner\u2014their ideal partner preferences\u2014direct romantic partner\
  \ selection and retention. He is also interested in exploring how close relationships\
  \ research can inform evolutionary psychological approaches (and vice versa), especially\
  \ with respect to the way that relationships grow and develop over time.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about close relationships, and the interrelation between relationship\
  \ science and evolutionary psychology. Topics include pair-bonding; short-term and\
  \ long-term relationships; what we can learn from speed-dating studies; the Relationship\
  \ Coordination and Strategic Timing (ReCAST) Model; and what males relationships\
  \ last, and if people are good at predicting how romantic breakups will affect them\
  \ emotionally.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:56  Pair-bonding  \n02:28  Studying short-term\
