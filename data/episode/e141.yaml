shownotes: "Dr. Moshe Hoffman is a Research Scientist at MIT Media Lab & Lecturer\
  \ at Harvard's Department of Economics. He applies game theory, models of learning\
  \ and evolution, and experimental methods, to try to decipher the (often subconscious\
  \ and subtle) incentives that shape our social behavior, preferences, and ideologies.\
  \ Dr. Hoffman obtained his Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Chicago, Booth\
  \ School of Business and his B.S. in Economics from the University of Chicago. He\
  \ also co-designed and teaches \"Game Theory and Social Behavior\" which lays out\
  \ a lot of the evidence and models behind this approach.\n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ talk about Game Theory. We first establish the aspects of behavior Game Theory\
  \ studies, and how it does it, referring to strategies of social interaction studied\
  \ by Robert Axelrod, which Richard Dawkins talks about in The Selfish Gene. In the\
  \ second part of the interview, we go through the critiques that Dr. Hoffman made\
  \ of Evolutionary Psychology (https://twitter.com/Moshe_Hoffman/status/1073270050809937923),\
  \ focusing on aesthetics, religion, and social norms and morality.\n\nTime Links:\
