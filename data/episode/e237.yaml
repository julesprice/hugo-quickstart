  \ Economic Life. \n\nThis interview is based on Chapter 3 (Game Theory and Human\
  \ Behavior) of The Bounds of Reason: Game Theory and the Unification of the Behavioral\
  \ Sciences.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about altruism and self-interest, as revealed\
  \ through lab and field studies of human behavior. First, we discuss what is rationality,\
  \ the literature on human biases and heuristics and why that does not show that\
  \ humans are irrational. We talk about the difference between self-interested and\
  \ self-regarding behavior. Then, we get into how we can use game theory to study\
  \ human sociality, and the aspects of it we can learn about through different game\
  \ designs, like the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, the Public Goods Game, and the Ultimatum\
  \ Game. Finally, we talk about how we can make sense of the interplay between people\u2019\
  s social dynamics and their culture; the phenomenon of gene-culture coevolution;\
  \ and the role cultural group selection might have played in the evolution of certain\
  \ aspects of our sociality, like altruism and strong reciprocity.\n\nTime Links:\
