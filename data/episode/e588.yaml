  at Northwestern University. Jennifer Lackey specializes in epistemology, with a
  particular emphasis on a broad range of issues in social epistemology. Her recent
  work focuses on false confessions, the criminal justice system, the duty to object,
  norms of credibility, the epistemic status of punishment, the epistemology of groups,
  expertise, and the distribution of epistemic goods. She is the author of several

  <p>In this episode, we talk about The Epistemology of Groups. We first get into
  basic questions in the epistemology of groups, like what is a group, individual
  and collective levels of analysis, and group agency. We discuss how to attribute
  moral responsibility to groups and individuals. We talk about beliefs, what they
  are from a group perspective, and what justifies them. We talk about social knowledge,
  group assertions, and group lies, and how to distinguish between individual and
  group lies. Finally, we discuss epistemic phenomena that the epistemology of groups
  sheds new light on, and future research on the epistemology of groups.</p>
