shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 24th 2023.  \nDr. Eric Funkhouser is Professor and Departmental\
  \ Chair of Philosophy at the University of Arkansas. His main areas of research\
  \ are in the philosophy of psychology/mind and metaphysics. He is currently working\
  \ on a series of papers concerning how social forces shape the functions of belief\
  \ and other mental states. This work should culminate in a book, The Signaling Mind:\
  \ Belief as Social Manipulation. In this manuscript, he argues that many beliefs\
  \ serve a signaling function\u2014much like animal signals used to manipulate other\
  \ animals\u2014that explains various irrational and dangerous beliefs, cognitive\
  \ biases, as well as pro-social beliefs.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about beliefs,\
  \ and self-deception. We first discuss what beliefs are, if they are always conscious,\
  \ and how we study them. We talk about how to interpret incongruencies between belief\
  \ and behavior. We discuss the signaling functions of beliefs, and how they apply\
  \ to irrational beliefs, cognitive biases, and dangerous beliefs. We then get into\
  \ self-deception, and discuss the different philosophical and scientific approaches\
  \ to it. We also talk about the functions of self-deception, and discuss if it really\
  \ works.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:42  What are beliefs?  \n04:55  Are\
