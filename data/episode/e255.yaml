shownotes: "<p>Dr. Mark Sheskin is Assistant Professor of Social Sciences at Minerva\
  \ Schools at KGI, and a Research Affiliate at Yale University, where he is coordinating\
  \ thechidlab.com. His research interests are at the intersection of philosophy and\
  \ psychology, with a particular focus on the origins of prosocial behavior and moral\
  \ judgment.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about the developmental psychology\
  \ of morality and moral philosophy. We start off with children\u2019s care for equality\
  \ and fairness, including the development of numerical and quality equality. We\
  \ also refer to what we can learn from studying close primates. We discuss if morality\
  \ can be objective. And near the end we also talk about how people think about economic\
  \ inequality, and if it is a problem by itself, or if fairness is more important.</p>\n\
