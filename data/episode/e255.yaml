shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 5th, 2019.  \nDr. Mark Sheskin is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Social Sciences at Minerva Schools at KGI, and a Research Affiliate at Yale\
  \ University, where he is coordinating thechidlab.com. His research interests are\
  \ at the intersection of philosophy and psychology, with a particular focus on the\
  \ origins of prosocial behavior and moral judgment. \n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about the developmental psychology of morality and moral philosophy. We start\
  \ off with children\u2019s care for equality and fairness, including the development\
  \ of numerical and quality equality. We also refer to what we can learn from studying\
  \ close primates. We discuss if morality can be objective. And near the end we also\
  \ talk about how people think about economic inequality, and if it is a problem\
  \ by itself, or if fairness is more important.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:41  Do children\
