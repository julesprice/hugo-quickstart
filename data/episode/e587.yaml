shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 28th 2021.  \nVictoria Dougherty is the author of\
  \ The Bone Church, Welcome to the Hotel Yalta, and Cold. She writes fiction, drama,\
  \ and essays that revolve around lovers, killers, curses, and destinies. Her work\
  \ has been published or profiled in the New York Times, USA Today, The International\
  \ Herald Tribune, and elsewhere. Earlier in her career, while living in Prague,\
  \ she co-founded Black Box Theater, translating, producing, and acting in several\
  \ Czech plays. Her blog \u2013 COLD \u2013 features her short essays on faith, family,\
  \ love, and writing. WordPress, the blogging platform that hosts some 70 million\
  \ blogs worldwide, has singled out COLD as one of the Top 50 Recommended Blogs by\
  \ writers or about writing. \n\nThis is our third talk, and the most philosophical\
  \ one to date.  \nIn this episode, we talk about Fernando Pessoa, nihilism; if fictional\
  \ writing is honest and truthful; how writing fiction can help you understand different\
  \ people and their personalities; the horror genre, Ingmar Bergman, and the fear\
  \ of estrangement; what it\u2019s like living with depression; the importance of\
  \ romantic relationships; Victoria\u2019s influences in her writing; the limitations\
  \ of writing in comparison to other arts; how comic books can be so great; and how\
  \ we always get boring parts in stories; and why I only write when I\u2019m in love.\n\
