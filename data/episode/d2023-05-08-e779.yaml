  <p>In this episode, we talk about stereotypes, criminal justice, and friendships.
  We discuss what stereotypes are, where they stem from, their different types, ecology-driven
  stereotypes, their connection to prejudice, and their social functions. We talk
  a bit about emotions from an evolutionary perspective, and how they apply to mediation
  contexts. We discuss how people develop perceptions of criminal behavior, and when
  and why they endorse the death penalty. Finally, we talk about friendships, who
  we want as friends, and friendship jealousy.</p>
