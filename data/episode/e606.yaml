shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 20th 2021.  \nDr. Peter Sterling is Professor of\
  \ Neuroscience in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\
  \ His broad goal has been to learn how the brain is designed \u2013 to understand\
  \ its functional architecture. His research has spanned the full range of scales,\
  \ from nanoscopic (synaptic vesicles), to microscopic (neural circuits), to macroscopic\
  \ (regional neuroanatomy and behavior). His laboratory focused on retinal structure\
  \ and function, but his theoretical interests extended to basic issues of physiological\
  \ regulation and behavior, leading to the concept of allostasis. He is the author\
  \ of books like Principles of Neural Design, and What is health? Allostasis and\
  \ the Evolution of Human Design.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on What is health?.\
  \ We start by talking about the best way to approach the study of how the brain\
  \ is designed, and how to study it at different scales. We discuss the concept of\
  \ \u201Callostasis\u201D. We talk about four epochs that characterize the design\
  \ of the human brain. We discuss the concept of \u201Coptimality\u201D in design.\
  \ We talk about an explanation for things like music, art, play, comedy, and laughter.\
  \ Finally, we get a bit into questions surrounding modern medicine, like how to\
  \ distinguish between a disorder and expected variation, and the problem with the\
  \ principle of homeostasis.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:58  Studying how\
