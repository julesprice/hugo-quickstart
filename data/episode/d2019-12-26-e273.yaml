shownotes: "<p>Dr. David Puts is Associate Professor of Anthropology at Pennsylvania\
  \ State University. Dr. Puts studies the neuroendocrine and evolutionary bases of\
  \ human sexuality and sex differences, with special focus on behavior and psychology.\
  \ His research topics include the influence of sex hormones on psychology, behavior,\
  \ and anatomy; hormonal and genetic influences on sexual differentiation; sexual\
  \ selection and the evolution of sex differences in voices, faces, bodies, brains,\
  \ and behavior; the development and evolution of variation in sexual orientation;\
  \ and the evolution of female orgasm.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about some\
  \ of the major topics of Dr. Puts\u2019 research. First, we discuss sexual selection\
  \ and how it is essential to learn more about the evolution of human sexual dimorphism.\
  \ We then talk about sex differences, focusing on the brain and cognition. We also\
  \ refer to some of the main lines of evidence that point toward a biological basis\
  \ for these differences. We also go through the biological foundations of sexual\
  \ orientation, as well as current hypotheses for the evolution of female orgasm.</p>\n\
