  \ interests include aging and the life course, psychosocial factors influences on\
  \ health over the life course, and end-of-life issues. Her latest book is Aging\
  \ in America.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on aging, but also tackle other\
  \ social issues in the US. We first discuss the obesity \u201Cepidemic\u201D, the\
  \ causes of obesity, and weight stigma. We talk about the relationship between the\
  \ kinds of physical activity people engage in and perceived health. We discuss the\
  \ life trajectories and long-term planning of married and single people. We talk\
  \ about challenges in time management for married couples with children, changes\
  \ in gender roles, and work-life balance. We discuss challenges disabled people\
  \ face (during the pandemic, at work, and in old age), and how hard it is being\
  \ poor/leaving poverty. We talk about racial and ethnic differences in healthcare\
  \ planning, how perceptions of survival affect it, and end-of-life decisions. Finally,\
  \ we discuss how widowhood affects people, and the social effects of inequality.</p>\n"
