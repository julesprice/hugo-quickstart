  at National University, and Director of the Cognitive Neuroscience of Religion Project,
  along with Dr. Jordan Grafman. He is the author of The Cognitive Neuroscience of

  <p>In this episode, we focus on The Cognitive Neuroscience of Religious Experience.
  We start by talking about the use of neuroscience in the study of religion, the
  evolution of religion, its role in gene-culture coevolution, and religion as a transformational
  technology. We then go through decentering, the divided self, the cognitive mechanisms
  and brain conditions that give rise to religiosity, psychedelics, mystical experiences,
  supernatural agents, rituals, and the relationship between language and religion.</p>
