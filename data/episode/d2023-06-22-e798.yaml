shownotes: '<p>Dr. Onurcan Yilmaz is an Associate Professor of Psychology at Kadir
  Has University, Istanbul, and he currently leads the Moral Intuitions Laboratory
  (MINT Lab). He studies the intersection between morality, religion, politics and
  decision-making from perspectives derived from cognitive and evolutionary psychology
  and behavioral economics.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about cognitive styles, politics, morality, and religion.
  We start by talking about cognitive styles, and then go through several different
  links: between cognitive style and political ideology; between analytic thinking
  and moral foundations; between analytic thinking and economic conservatism; between
  cognitive style and religiosity; between personality traits and political convictions;
  between morality and politics; and between morality and religion. We talk about
  analytic thinking training. We discuss if science can increase moral sensitivity,
  and if belief in God can be induced in non-believers. We talk about the relationship
  between cognitive style and normative views, and how psychopathy is related to utilitarianism.
  Finally, we discuss if people have fixed normative principles.</p>
