  \ we focus on DSM. We start with a bit of the history of Psychiatry, and how the\
  \ first psychiatric diagnoses appeared. We talk about the creation of the DSM, and\
  \ its cultural impact. We cover three interpretations of the DSM: scientific progress;\
  \ harmful impacts; and the social perspective. We talk about how mental disorders\
  \ are researched, and their characteristics. We get into the DSM-5, and its promises.\
  \ We discuss the merits and shortcomings of a biological approach to mental disorders.\
  \ Finally, we talk about the future of the DSM, its positive impact, and what should\
  \ be changed.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:30  The history of Psychiatry\
