shownotes: "<p>Dr. Gareth Leng was one of the founders in 1983 of the British Society\
  \ for Neuroendocrinology. He was appointed as the Chair of Experimental Physiology\
  \ at the University of Edinburgh in 1994, after 17 years at what is now the Babraham\
  \ Institute, Cambridge. He is a former Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Neuroendocrinology,\
  \ and a former President of the International Neuroendocrine Federation. He is the\
  \ author of The Matter of Facts: Skepticism, Persuasion, and Evidence in Science.</p>\n\
  <p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on The Matter of Facts. We talk about what\
  \ evidence is; structure and norms in science; the \u201Cscientific method\u201D\
  ; Thomas Kuhn, scientific revolutions, and paradigms. We discuss issues with scientific\
  \ publication and citation. We discuss if science is value-free, if it is done by\
  \ individual geniuses, and if we can communicate science through narratives. Finally,\
  \ we address a question from a patron of the show, regarding why people tend to\
  \ rely more on authority than evidence, and what we can do about it.</p>\n"
