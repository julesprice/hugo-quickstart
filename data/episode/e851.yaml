  This show is sponsored by Enlites, Learning & Development done differently. Check\
  \ the website here: http://enlites.com/\n\nDr. Alecia Carter is Associate Professor\
  \ in the Department of Anthropology at University College London. Her current research\
  \ investigates (1) how primates respond to the deaths of others and what this can\
  \ tell us about the evolution of cognition and emotion and (2) how individuals access\
  \ information to make decisions. In particular, she studies how individuals use\
  \ their social environment to access information, and how their phenotype, their\
  \ individual characteristics, may limit their use of that information. Her previous\
  \ research addressed how and why animals' behavior varies from others but is consistent\
  \ through time.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about thanatology, animal personality,\
  \ and culture. We talk about what thanatology is, and go through some of the ways\
  \ baboons react to infants\u2019 corpses, with a focus on carrying behaviors. We\
  \ discuss issues related to anthropomorphism and biological continuity. We then\
  \ talk about conceptual and methodological challenges in the study of animal personality;\
  \ studying personality in the wild versus the lab; and comparing personality across\
  \ species. We discuss how social learning is studied in behavioral ecology, and\
  \ we talk about culture, social transmission of information, and innovation. Finally,\
  \ we discuss Dr. Carter\u2019s work on women\u2019s visibility in academic seminars.\n\
