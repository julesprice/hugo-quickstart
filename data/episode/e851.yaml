shownotes: "<p>Dr. Alecia Carter is Associate Professor in the Department of Anthropology\
  \ at University College London. Her current research investigates (1) how primates\
  \ respond to the deaths of others and what this can tell us about the evolution\
  \ of cognition and emotion and (2) how individuals access information to make decisions.\
  \ In particular, she studies how individuals use their social environment to access\
  \ information, and how their phenotype, their individual characteristics, may limit\
  \ their use of that information. Her previous research addressed how and why animals&#39;\
  \ behavior varies from others but is consistent through time.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In\
  \ this episode, we talk about thanatology, animal personality, and culture. We talk\
  \ about what thanatology is, and go through some of the ways baboons react to infants\u2019\
  \ corpses, with a focus on carrying behaviors. We discuss issues related to anthropomorphism\
  \ and biological continuity. We then talk about conceptual and methodological challenges\
  \ in the study of animal personality; studying personality in the wild versus the\
  \ lab; and comparing personality across species. We discuss how social learning\
  \ is studied in behavioral ecology, and we talk about culture, social transmission\
  \ of information, and innovation. Finally, we discuss Dr. Carter\u2019s work on\
  \ women\u2019s visibility in academic seminars.</p>\n"
