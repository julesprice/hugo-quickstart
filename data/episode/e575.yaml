shownotes: '<p>Dr. J. Michael Bailey is an American psychologist, behavioral geneticist,
  and professor at Northwestern University. His interests include sexual orientation,
  gender nonconformity, sexual arousal, behavior genetics, and evolutionary psychology.
  He maintains that sexual orientation is heavily influenced by biology and male homosexuality

  <p>In this episode, we talk about sexual orientation, sexual arousal, gender identity,
  and transsexualism. We start with sexual orientation, the different kinds out there,
  if it is inborn, and if we have already been able to identify brain areas or genes
  associated with it. We discuss sexual arousal, what is it, how it is measured, and
  femininity-masculinity. We also mention the fraternal birth order effect in homosexuality.
  We talk about gender identity and gender nonconformity. We discuss transsexualism
  and its different kinds, including homosexual transexuals and autogynephilic transexuals.
  We talk about gynandromorphophilic men. Finally, we discuss the relationship between
  behavior genetics and evolutionary psychology.</p>
