shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 1st 2021.  \nDr. J. Michael Bailey is an American\
  \ psychologist, behavioral geneticist, and professor at Northwestern University.\
  \ His interests include sexual orientation, gender nonconformity, sexual arousal,\
  \ behavior genetics, and evolutionary psychology. He maintains that sexual orientation\
  \ is heavily influenced by biology and male homosexuality is most likely inborn.\
  \ Dr. Bailey wrote The Man Who Would Be Queen, a book intended to explain the biology\
  \ of male sexual orientation and gender to a general audience, focusing on gender\
  \ nonconforming boys, gay men and male-to-female transsexuals.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about sexual orientation, sexual arousal, gender identity, and transsexualism.\
  \ We start with sexual orientation, the different kinds out there, if it is inborn,\
  \ and if we have already been able to identify brain areas or genes associated with\
  \ it. We discuss sexual arousal, what is it, how it is measured, and femininity-masculinity.\
  \ We also mention the fraternal birth order effect in homosexuality. We talk about\
  \ gender identity and gender nonconformity. We discuss transsexualism and its different\
  \ kinds, including homosexual transexuals and autogynephilic transexuals. We talk\
  \ about gynandromorphophilic men. Finally, we discuss the relationship between behavior\
  \ genetics and evolutionary psychology.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:35 \
