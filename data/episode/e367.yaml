shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 11th, 2020.  \nDr. Christophe Heintz is Associate Professor\
  \ at the Central European University, where he leads the research group ACE (Adaptive\
  \ Cognition and Economics). Dr. Heintz is working on the role of adaptive cognition\
  \ in shaping economic behavior, cultural evolution, and the history of science.\
  \ Scientific practices and economic choices have traditionally been described as\
  \ rational. He attempts to describe them as resulting from both environmental/contextual\
  \ and psychological causal factors, with a focus on evolved cognition.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about adaptive cognition and cognitive history applied to economic\
  \ choices and science. During our talk, we also discuss cultural attraction theory,\
  \ reasoning, and folk epistemology.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:56  What is adaptive cognition?\
