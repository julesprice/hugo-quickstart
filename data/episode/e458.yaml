shownotes: "Dr. Lesley Newson is honorary post-doc at University of California, Davis.\
  \ She studies the cultural evolutionary process known as \u201Cmodernization\u201D\
  \ which most human populations are now experiencing. Her first degree was in biology.\
  \ After that she worked for over 20 years as a science writer and television producer\
  \ before getting a PhD in psychology.  \nDr. Peter Richerson is Distinguished Professor\
  \ Emeritus of the Department of Environmental Science and Policy at the University\
  \ of California, Davis. He\u2019s a biologist with interest in cultural evolution,\
  \ animal social learning and mathematical models. He\u2019s also the author of books\
  \ like Culture and the Evolutionary Process, Not by Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed\
  \ Human Evolution, and The Origin and Evolution of Cultures, all written in collaboration\
  \ with Dr. Robert Boyd.  \nThey are both authors of a recent book, A Story of Us:\
  \ A New Look at Human Evolution.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on A Story of Us.\
  \ We start with general questions: the relationship between biology and culture;\
  \ gene-culture coevolution; human behavioral flexibility; and human universals.\
  \ We then get into the evolutionary story presented in the book, and go through:\
  \ our last common ancestor with chimpanzees and bonobos; bipedal apes from 3 million\
  \ years ago; early humans from 1.5 million years ago; humans from 100.000 years\
  \ ago; human societies from 30.000 and 10.000 years ago; and modernity. We also\
  \ discuss the concept of \u201Csocial tools\u201D, and the importance of our life\
  \ history in our evolution. We talk about current and future challenges. We then\
  \ go back to some general questions, and discuss some criticisms of evolutionary\
  \ psychology; group selection; social selection; and \u201Chuman nature\u201D. We\
  \ finish with a question from a patron.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:34 \
