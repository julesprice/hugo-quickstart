  \ University. He\u2019s a theoretical sociologist who seeks to develop general explanations\
  \ of human behavior, his work focuses primarily on conflict and social control,\
  \ including various means of expressing grievances, handling disputes, and punishing\
  \ offenses. Within this area he specializes in violent conflict, particularly in\
  \ self-destructive forms of violence such as protest suicide, homicide-suicide,\
  \ and suicide terrorism. His other interests include the sociology of science, sociology\
