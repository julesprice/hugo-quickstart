shownotes: "<p>Dr. Andrew Thomas is a Lecturer in Psychology at Swansea University,\
  \ UK. His research is concerned with the differences in mating strategies within\
  \ and between the sexes. This includes environmental and social factors which contribute\
  \ to this variance and whether mating preferences themselves are reactive to environmental\
  \ changes over short term periods. He also has a secondary interest in cyber-psychology\
  \ and online interaction; particularly how one represents oneself using internet\
  \ avatars and aliases.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about some of the knowledge\
  \ coming from evolutionary psychology about the mating preferences of men and women,\
  \ and also about some of the research from Dr. Thomas on that matter. More specifically,\
  \ we discuss if the idea of more than 2 genders has any scientific plausibility,\
  \ and if sex and gender are two distinct entities; the model of Males Compete Females\
  \ Choose (MCFC) that is still dominant in evolutionary psychology, and the alternative\
  \ of MMC (Mutual Mate Choice); and we end up addressing some of studies done in\
  \ cyberpsychology, namely in online games and social media, and their limitations.</p>\n\

summary: Dr. Andrew Thomas is a Lecturer in Psychology at Swansea University, UK.
  His research is concerned with the differences in mating strategies within and between
  the sexes. This includes environmental and social factors which contribute to this
