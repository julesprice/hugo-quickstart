  <p>In this episode, we talk about Why It\u2019s OK to Speak Your Mind. &nbsp;We\
  \ start by discussing the concept of \u201Cepistemic commons\u201D, and talking\
  \ about how we reason better collectively. We talk about free speech, and constraints\
  \ on knowledge production. We discuss the social costs of speaking our minds, and\
  \ the morality of it. We talk about how people\u2019s beliefs have much more to\
  \ do with social signaling than the ideas themselves. We discuss the distinction\
  \ between healthy dissenting and contrarianism and trolling. We ask if governments\
  \ should make efforts to defend our epistemic commons. We discuss some of the strongest\
  \ objections to the thesis of the book, and also the tension between the necessary\
  \ social isolation to achieve enlightenment and the fact that we need other people\
  \ to reason better. We refer to the dangers of political engagement and moralizing\
  \ discussions contaminating public discourse. Finally, we talk about the virtue\
  \ of honesty, and the problem with convictions, from a Nietzschean perspective.</p>\n"
