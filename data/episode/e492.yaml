shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 3rd 2021.  \nDr. Hrishikesh Joshi is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Philosophy at Bowling Green State University. He works on moral and political\
  \ philosophy. He is the author of Why It\u2019s OK to Speak Your Mind.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about Why It\u2019s OK to Speak Your Mind.  We start by discussing\
  \ the concept of \u201Cepistemic commons\u201D, and talking about how we reason\
  \ better collectively. We talk about free speech, and constraints on knowledge production.\
  \ We discuss the social costs of speaking our minds, and the morality of it. We\
  \ talk about how people\u2019s beliefs have much more to do with social signaling\
  \ than the ideas themselves. We discuss the distinction between healthy dissenting\
  \ and contrarianism and trolling. We ask if governments should make efforts to defend\
  \ our epistemic commons. We discuss some of the strongest objections to the thesis\
  \ of the book, and also the tension between the necessary social isolation to achieve\
  \ enlightenment and the fact that we need other people to reason better. We refer\
  \ to the dangers of political engagement and moralizing discussions contaminating\
  \ public discourse. Finally, we talk about the virtue of honesty, and the problem\
  \ with convictions, from a Nietzschean perspective.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
