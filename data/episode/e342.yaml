shownotes: "RECORDED ON April 21st, 2020.  \nDr. H. Clark Barrett is Professor in\
  \ the Department of Anthropology, and the Director of the Center for Behavior, Evolution\
  \ and Culture at UCLA. He is a biological anthropologist specializing in evolutionary\
  \ psychology, the study of the mind\u2019s evolved mechanisms and processes. In\
  \ his work he uses methods from anthropology and psychology to examine universals\
  \ and variation in how thinking develops across cultures. He conducts field research\
  \ among the Shuar, an indigenous culture in southeast Ecuador, as well as in Los\
  \ Angeles. His research has focused on learning and conceptual development in several\
  \ domains, including \u201Ctheory of mind,\u201D or the ability to make inferences\
  \ about others\u2019 thoughts and intentions, and learning about danger. He has\
  \ also collaborated with a variety of anthropologists, psychologists, and other\
  \ social scientists on a variety of topics ranging from infant-directed speech to\
  \ the evolution of morality, and supervise graduate projects on the evolution of\
  \ cognition. He\u2019s the author of the book The Shape of Thought: How Mental Adaptations\
  \ Evolve.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on the topic of mental adaptations. We first\
  \ ask what a mental adaptation is. We also refer to modularity of mind, and talk\
  \ about domain-specific and domain-general modules. Toward the end, we discuss dual-systems\
  \ theory, and the role that consciousness plays in decision-making.\n\nTime Links:\
