shownotes: "Dr. Joseph Carroll is a scholar in the field of literature and evolution.\
  \ He is currently Curators\u2019 Professor at the University of Missouri\u2013St.\
  \ Louis, where he has taught since 1985. Dr. Carroll's Evolution and Literary Theory\
  \ was one of the first literary studies to \"take the cue from important developments\
  \ in disciplines such as evolutionary psychology, evolutionary anthropology, and\
  \ sociobiology,\" seeing evolutionary biology as an alternative to poststructuralism\
  \ and rejecting poststructuralism's textualism (the notion that world is made of\
  \ words) and indeterminancy (the self-subverting character of \"discourse\"). He\u2019\
  s also the author of Literary Darwinism: Evolution, Human Nature and Literature,\
  \ Reading Human Nature, Graphing Jane Austen, has also produced an edition of Charles\
  \ Darwin\u2019s On the Origin of Species, co-edited volumes 1 and 2 of The Evolutionary\
  \ Review, and co-edited Evolution, Literature, and Film: A Reader.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we discuss Literary Darwinism. We talk about important insights that came from\
  \ sociobiology and evolutionary psychology and how that helped get past approaches\
  \ like poststructuralism and deconstructionism. We also talk about the interplay\
  \ between culture and biology, and some of the most relevant aspects of human psychology\
  \ in literature, as well as how to properly talk about social and cultural constructs\
  \ with biology at their basis. We go through some of the most distinct approaches\
  \ and hypotheses put forth by evolutionary theorists as to the biological bases\
  \ of the arts and literature and how they work, from Pinker\u2019s mental cheesecake,\
  \ to E. O. Wilson\u2019s imaginative virtual worlds, to Geoffrey Miller and sexual\
  \ selection, and to Gad Saad\u2019s consumer behavior and cognitive modules at the\
  \ basis of fiction. We also refer to human universals and Jungian archetypes. Finally,\
  \ we talk about how to approach the study of meaning in literature, and in what\
  \ ways Darwinism and evolutionary theory can contribute to the modernization of\
  \ the Humanities.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:25  What is Literary Darwinism?  \n03:05\
