  \ Review, and co-edited Evolution, Literature, and Film: A Reader.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we discuss Literary Darwinism. We talk about important insights that\
  \ came from sociobiology and evolutionary psychology and how that helped get past\
  \ approaches like poststructuralism and deconstructionism. We also talk about the\
  \ interplay between culture and biology, and some of the most relevant aspects of\
  \ human psychology in literature, as well as how to properly talk about social and\
  \ cultural constructs with biology at their basis. We go through some of the most\
  \ distinct approaches and hypotheses put forth by evolutionary theorists as to the\
  \ biological bases of the arts and literature and how they work, from Pinker\u2019\
  s mental cheesecake, to E. O. Wilson\u2019s imaginative virtual worlds, to Geoffrey\
  \ Miller and sexual selection, and to Gad Saad\u2019s consumer behavior and cognitive\
  \ modules at the basis of fiction. We also refer to human universals and Jungian\
  \ archetypes. Finally, we talk about how to approach the study of meaning in literature,\
  \ and in what ways Darwinism and evolutionary theory can contribute to the modernization\
  \ of the Humanities.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Carroll\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty\
