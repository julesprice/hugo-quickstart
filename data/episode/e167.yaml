shownotes: "Dr. Rani Lill Anjum is Research Fellow in Philosophy at the Norwegian\
  \ University of Life Sciences (NMBU) School of Economics and Business, and Leader\
  \ of the CAPS \u2013 Center for Applied Philosophy of Science since 2018. She spent\
  \ two years at the University of Nottingham, working with Professor Stephen Mumford\
  \ on dispositions and causation from 2007 to 2009. Together they developed a new\
  \ theory of causation. After Nottingham, she got funding from FRIPRO NFR for a 4-year\
  \ research project, Causation in Science (CauSci), hosted by the Norwegian University\
  \ of Life Sciences (NMBU) from January 2011. In May 2014 she was offered a permanent\
  \ contract as Research Fellow at HH NMBU. In December 2014 her new research project\
  \ Causation, Complexity and Evidence in Health Sciences (CauseHealth) got funded\
  \ by FRIPRO and started up in the spring 2015 at NMBU. In 2018 she established NMBU\
  \ CAPS \u2013 Centre for Applied Philosophy of Science. Dr. Lill Anjum has coauthored\
  \ 4 books with Dr. Stephen Mumford: Getting Causes from Powers (2011), Causation:\
  \ A Very Short Introduction (2013), Causation in Science and the Methods of Scientific\
  \ Discovery (2018), and What Tends to Be: The Philosophy of Dispositional Modality\
  \ (2018).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the philosophy of causation, and a new\
  \ approach to causation in philosophy and science developed by Dr. Lill Anjum in\
  \ collaboration with Dr. Stephen Mumford, based on a metaphysics of powers or dispositions.\
  \ We discuss how we should think about causality when there are several factors\
  \ acting on a particular phenomenon; the intrinsic limitations of scientific models\
  \ of the world; how can shifting from neuron diagrams of causal relations to vectors\
  \ might improve those same models; and reductionism and emergentism. Throughout\
  \ the interview, Dr. Lill Anjum illustrates all of these issues with examples coming\
  \ from medicine, an area she has been focusing a lot of her work on causation recently.\n\
