shownotes: "<p>Dr. Fran\xE7oise Baylis is University Research Professor at Dalhousie\
  \ University, Canada. She is a frequent guest on CBC and Radio Canada. The focus\
  \ of her research is on issues of women's health and assisted reproductive technologies,\
  \ but her research and publication record also extend to such topics as research\
  \ involving humans (including human embryo research), gene editing, novel genetic\
  \ technologies, public health, the role of bioethics consultants, and neuroethics.\
  \ She has a forthcoming book on ethics and heritable genome editing with Harvard\
  \ University Press.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about the ethics behind CRISPR-cas9\
  \ genome editing technology. The difference between using it in somatic cells versus\
  \ germline cells; he fuzzy line that separates enhancement from therapy; the example\
  \ of improving IQ; how this technology can increase the gap between rich and poor,\
  \ taking it to the whole new level of biological differences; individual and social\
  \ considerations; and animal ethics. We finish off by talking a little bit about\
  \ Dr. Baylis\u2019 upcoming book.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>01:02 What is CRISPR-cas9?</p>\n\
