shownotes: "<p>Dr. Hugo Mercier is a research scientist at the CNRS \u2013 Centre\
  \ National de la Recherche Scientifique (Institut Jean Nicod), where he works with\
  \ the Evolution and Social Cognition team. Most of his work so far has focused on\
  \ the function and workings of reasoning. Together with Dan Sperber, he wrote a\
  \ book that develops and extends the argumentative theory of reasoning, called The\
  \ Enigma of Reason.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on The Enigma of Reason, and\
  \ talk about how reason might have evolved, and its cognitive and social function.\
  \ We talk a little bit about the notion of the modular mind. Also, how cognition\
  \ operates at a subconscious level; the conditions in which reason works best; if\
  \ dual-process theory (the idea of us having two different cognitive systems \u2013\
  \ one more fast and frugal, and the other more deliberative) makes sense from this\
  \ new perspective; what really is a \u201Crational\u201D behavior; and why science\
  \ as a human enterprise works so well.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:36 How do\
