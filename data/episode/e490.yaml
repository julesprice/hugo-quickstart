shownotes: "<p>Dr. Mark Stoneking directs the Human Population History Group in the\
  \ Department of Evolutionary Genetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary\
  \ Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. He is also Honorary Professor of Biological\
  \ Anthropology at the University of Leipzig. He, along with his doctoral advisor\
  \ Allan Wilson and a fellow researcher Rebecca L. Cann, contributed to the Out of\
  \ Africa Theory in 1987 by introducing the concept of Mitochondrial Eve.</p>\n<p>In\
  \ this episode, we talk about evolutionary genetics. We start by talking about the\
  \ discipline of evolutionary genetics, and the kinds of questions it tries to answer.\
  \ We then talk about the Mitochondrial Eve, the interaction between nuclear and\
  \ mitochondrial DNA, and how to study paternal lineages. We discuss human genetic\
  \ diversity, and if the concept of \u201Crace\u201D is a scientific one. We then\
  \ address how genetics can help us understand cultural evolution, and talk specifically\
  \ about is it is possible to study the evolution of languages through genetics.\
  \ We tackle other questions about our evolution, including if it is possible to\
  \ tell which hominin species we evolved from, and why we find less diversity out\
  \ of Africa. We discuss a study Dr. Stoneking did on the Mlabri, and if contemporary\
  \ hunter-gatherer societies are good models of ancient ones. Finally, we talk about\
  \ evidence of recent genetic evolution.</p>\n"
