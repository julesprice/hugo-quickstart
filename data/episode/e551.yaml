shownotes: "Dr. Louise Barrett is Professor of Psychology and Canada Research Chair\
  \ in Cognition, Evolution & Behaviour at the University of Lethbridge. She ran a\
  \ long-term project on baboons in South Africa for twelve years, and currently co-directs\
  \ the Samara Vervet Monkey Project in South Africa. Her research programme centers\
  \ on the issue of how ecology shapes patterns of sociality and cognitive evolution,\
  \ and includes work on thermal physiology and responses to climate change, parental\
  \ investment strategies, cooperation, sexual conflict, movement ecology, and infant\
  \ development. She is also interested in how culture and biology intersect to influence\
  \ human behavior, and runs projects on female reproductive decision-making in Independent\
  \ Samoa and the Canadian North. She is the author of Beyond the Brain: How Body\
  \ and Environment Shape Animal and Human Minds (Princeton University Press).\n\n\
  In this episode, we talk about evolutionary psychology. We start by talking about\
  \ behavioral ecology, and how ecological factors influence behavior. We discuss\
  \ the place of culture in the context of evolutionary psychology. We ask if the\
  \ brain-as-computer metaphor is scientifically useful. We talk about modularity\
  \ of mind. We discuss the place of behaviorism in contemporary psychological science.\
  \ We talk about enactivism, and embodied cognition. We then get into Dr. Barrett\u2019\
  s studies on baboon societies, and discuss things like individual-level movement\
  \ bias, and how it influences higher-order social structures in baboon societies.\
  \ We discuss the concept of \u201Csocial complexity\u201D. Other topics include\
  \ a valid version of genetic determinism; limitations of evolutionary psychology;\
  \ parsimony as a criterion in evolutionary theory; and the incorporation of embodied\
  \ cognition and the influence of the environment into evolutionary theory.\n\nTime\
