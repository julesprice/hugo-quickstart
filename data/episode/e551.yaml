shownotes: "<p>Dr. Louise Barrett is Professor of Psychology and Canada Research Chair\
  \ in Cognition, Evolution &amp; Behaviour at the University of Lethbridge. She is\
  \ the author of Beyond the Brain: How Body and Environment Shape Animal and Human\
  \ Minds (Princeton University Press).</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about evolutionary\
  \ psychology. We start by talking about behavioral ecology, and how ecological factors\
  \ influence behavior. We discuss the place of culture in the context of evolutionary\
  \ psychology. We ask if the brain-as-computer metaphor is scientifically useful.\
  \ We talk about modularity of mind. We discuss the place of behaviorism in contemporary\
  \ psychological science. We talk about enactivism, and embodied cognition. We then\
  \ get into Dr. Barrett\u2019s studies on baboon societies, and discuss things like\
  \ individual-level movement bias, and how it influences higher-order social structures\
  \ in baboon societies. We discuss the concept of \u201Csocial complexity\u201D.\
  \ Other topics include a valid version of genetic determinism; limitations of evolutionary\
  \ psychology; parsimony as a criterion in evolutionary theory; and the incorporation\
  \ of embodied cognition and the influence of the environment into evolutionary theory.</p>\n"
