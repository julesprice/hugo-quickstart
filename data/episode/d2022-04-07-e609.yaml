shownotes: "<p>Dr. Joel Marks is professor emeritus of philosophy at the University\
  \ of New Haven and a Bioethics Center Scholar at Yale University. His main areas\
  \ of scholarly interest have been theoretical and applied ethics, both having come\
  \ together in recent years in thinking about animal ethics. Meanwhile a new area\
  \ of interest is planetary defense (against comets and asteroids). He is the author\
  \ of several books, including Ethics Without Morals: In Defense of Amorality; It's\
  \ Just a Feeling: The Philosophy of Desirism; Hard Atheism and the Ethics of Desire:\
  \ An Alternative to Morality; and Reason and Ethics: The Case Against Objective\
  \ Value.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about morality, amorality, desirism, and\
  \ animal ethics. We start by asking if morality exists. We discuss the problematic\
  \ aspects of morality \u2013 being angry, hypocritical, arrogant, arbitrary, imprudent,\
  \ and silly. We talk about the alternative of amorality, and desirism, and how it\
  \ applies to animal ethics.</p>\n"
