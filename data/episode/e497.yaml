  \ of Political Science and Public Administration at Shandong University. He writes\
  \ widely on Chinese politics and philosophy for the media including the New York\
  \ Times, Financial times, Global Times, Nanfengchuang, Worldpost, Project Syndicate,\
  \ and the Guardian\u2019s Comment Is Free blog. Dr. Bell received the Huilin Prize\
  \ in 2018. He is the author of numerous books including The China Model: Political\
  \ Meritocracy and the Limits of Democracy (2015), The Spirit of Cities: Why the\
  \ Identity of a City Matters in a Global Age[coauthored with Avner de-Shalit] (2011),\
  \ China\u2019s New Confucianism: Politics and Everyday Life in a Changing Society\
  \ (2010), Beyond Liberal Democracy: Political Thinking for an East Asian Context\
  \ (2006), East Meets West: Human Rights and Democracy in East Asia (2000), and,\
  \ more recently, Just Hierarchy: Why Social Hierarchies Matter in China and the\
  \ Rest of the World.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Just Hierarchy. We first discuss\
  \ what is a hierarchy, and what makes for a just hierarchy. Throughout the conservation,\
  \ we refer to different kinds of hierarchies: relations between intimates; relations\
  \ between citizens; relations between states; relations between humans and nonhuman\
  \ animals; and relations between humans and AI. We talk about the progressive conservative\
  \ perspective to hierarchy presented in the book. We discuss the differences between\
  \ Chinese hierarchy and hierarchies in the West, and also how it relates to hierarchies\
  \ in other Eastern Asian countries. We also ask what could be some of the reasons\
  \ behind China\u2019s international success. Finally, we discuss what the West could\
  \ learn from China.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:32  What is a just hierarchy?\
