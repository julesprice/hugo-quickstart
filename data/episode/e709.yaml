shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 8th 2022.  \nDr. Jeanne Bovet is an Assistant Professor\
  \ at the Department of Psychology at Northumbria University. Broadly, she tries\
  \ to understand how evolution shaped our preferences, and what its consequences\
  \ are in our contemporary lives. Her work has covered various topics such as parent-offspring\
  \ conflict over mate choice, variation in feminine beauty standards through history,\
  \ sexual selection on age at menopause, and mate preferences for homogamy in facial\
  \ features. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about female attractiveness, and parent-offspring\
  \ conflict over mate choice. We first talk about the evolutionary rationale behind\
  \ female attractiveness, and what men evolved to find most attractive in women.\
  \ We get specifically into the waist-to-hip ratio, and facial attractiveness. We\
  \ discuss variation in female attractiveness across time and cultures. Finally,\
  \ we talk about parent-offspring conflict over mate choice.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
