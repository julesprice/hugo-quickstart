shownotes: "<p>Dr. Renee Magnan is Associate Professor and Director of Experimental\
  \ Training in the Department of Psychology at Washington State University. She applies\
  \ social psychological theory to address issues in preventive health behaviors and\
  \ health behavior promotion. Specifically, much of the research in her lab focuses\
  \ on understanding the role that affect (e.g., worry) plays on health decisions\
  \ and behavior (e.g., smoking cessation, exercise, cannabis). She is interested\
  \ in both how one\u2019s feelings about health behaviors may influence their decisions\
  \ to engage in health behavior and also how health behaviors may influence one\u2019\
  s feelings. Both perspectives can provide important insight to identify targets\
  \ for interventions to prevent negative health consequences and promote wellness.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we focus on Health Psychology. We dig into what is affect and\
  \ how it influences health behavior. We refer to the negative consequences of physical\
  \ inactivity, and its relationship with mental health. We also address addictive\
  \ behaviors, and adolescence and risky behavior of all types. Finally, we talk about\
  \ the types of health messaging that work the best, and also problems with medical\
  \ advice and treatment compliance, and how we can improve them.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
