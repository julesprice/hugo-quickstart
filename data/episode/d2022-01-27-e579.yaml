  <p>In this episode, we talk about the self, consciousness, pain, and psychiatry.
  We discuss what the self is and how people construct it. We talk about consciousness,
  its causal relationship to other aspects of the mind, and how to better study it.
  We talk about how pain is complex process. We ask if it is possible to distinguish
  between normal and abnormal psychological conditions, and what we can learn about
  by mind by studying conditions where it goes awry. Finally, we discuss the relationship
  between neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, and psychiatry, and the role
  philosophers play in these fields.</p>
