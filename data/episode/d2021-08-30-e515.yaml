shownotes: "<p>Sacha Altay is doing his PhD in cognitive science at the Institut Jean\
  \ Nicod of the \xC9cole Normale Sup\xE9rieure in Paris. Fascinated by apparently\
  \ irrational beliefs and behaviors, he works with Hugo Mercier on the role of epistemic\
  \ reputation in communication and the cognitive mechanisms underlying information\
  \ transmission and evaluation.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about fake news,\
  \ and scientific misinformation. We start with fake news, and discuss how widespread\
  \ it really is, and the sort of cultural and social factors behind fake news sharing.\
  \ We talk about misinformation on misinformation, and moral panics about fake news.\
  \ We also talk about scientific misinformation during the COVID pandemic, and how\
  \ governments and health authorities could have done a better job of communicating\
  \ COVID-related information. We finish with a discussion of what would make for\
  \ more effective science communication.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Sacha\u2019s work:</p>\n\
