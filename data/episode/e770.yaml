shownotes: "Dr. In\xEAs Hip\xF3lito is a Lecturer at the Berlin School of Mind and\
  \ Brain at Humboldt-Universit\xE4t zu Berlin, where she investigates the reciprocal\
  \ relationship between the representational structures, basic cognition, and the\
  \ nervous system. Additionally, as an Amsterdam Brain and Cognition Talent Grant\
  \ Fellow at the University of Amsterdam, she studies the emergence of artificial\
  \ intelligence as Augmented Cognition. Her research has earned her 19 awards and\
  \ she has presented her findings at over 30 scientific events, 7 of which she was\
  \ invited to speak as a keynote speaker. As a co-founder and vice-president of the\
  \ International Society of the Philosophy of the Sciences of the Mind, she is a\
  \ passionate advocate for diversity and inclusivity in the field, serving as an\
  \ elected member of the Women in Philosophy Committee and the Committee in Diversity\
  \ and Inclusivity at the Australasian Association of Philosophy.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we start by talking about embodied and enactive cognitive science.  We discuss\
  \ an enactive-dynamic model of cognition, and how to think about psychological traits.\
  \ We get into an enactive account of culture, and how psychological experiences\
  \ are interpreted in particular cultural contexts. We also discuss social cognition\
  \ from an enactivist perspective, and the role of theory of mind. We then talk about\
  \ enactive artificial intelligence. We discuss why technology is not neutral, and\
  \ feminist technoscience principles. We address a question from a patron regarding\
  \ AI and human cognition. Finally, we talk about the need for cognitive and cultural\
  \ diversity in science.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n01:05  Embodied and enactive\
