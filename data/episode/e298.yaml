shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 10th, 2019.  \nDr. Michael Inzlicht is a Research\
  \ Excellence Faculty Scholar at the University of Toronto. His primary appointment\
  \ is as Professor in the Department of Psychology, but he is also cross-appointed\
  \ as Professor at the Rotman School of Management. Dr. Inzlicht conducts research\
  \ that sits at the boundaries of social psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience.\
  \ Although he has published papers on the topics of prejudice, academic performance,\
  \ and religion, his most recent interests have been in the topics of self-control,\
  \ where he borrows methods from affective and cognitive neuroscience to understand\
  \ the underlying nature of self-control, including how it is driven by motivation.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus most of our conversation of self-control and things\
  \ related to it. First, I ask about social neuroscience, and what Dr. Inzlicht thinks\
  \ are the kinds of insights we can get from neuroscience about social psychology\
  \ phenomena. We then get into self-control, and talk about what is it, and the concept\
  \ of self-control strength. We address a paper from 2018 that tried to replicate\
  \ Walter Mischel\u2019s marshmallow test, and the capacity to delay gratification.\
  \ We also refer to one aspect of the recent APA guidelines for psychological practice\
  \ with men and boys, namely the repression/suppression of emotions. Still about\
  \ self-control, we discuss the interplay between emotion and cognition, the life\
  \ outcomes associated with this ability, and if there are any good interventions\
  \ proven to improve it. We then tackle aspects of the replication crisis in Psychology,\
  \ and go through some examples of phenomena that have recently been questioned,\
  \ like the ego-depletion effect and stereotype threat. \n\n\n\nTime Links:  \n00:57\
