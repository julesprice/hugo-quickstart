  \ and epistemology. She also has related interests in the ethics and epistemology\
  \ of AI.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about beliefs, confabulations, fake news,\
  \ and AI. We start with beliefs, what they are, and the different approaches in\
  \ philosophy of mind to try to understand how they work. We get into the concept\
  \ of belief\u2019s minimal rationality. We discuss the social functions of beliefs.\
  \ We go through post-hoc rationalizations and confabulations. We try to understand\
  \ why we confabulate. We ask why we can\u2019t deliberately believe what we want.\
  \ We get a bit into why people share fake stories online, and the several reasons\
  \ and motivations behind it. We discuss if it makes sense to ask if people are rational\
  \ or irrational. Finally, we talk a bit about the implications of AI systems potentially\
  \ developing some of the psychological abilities we explore in this talk.</p>\n"
