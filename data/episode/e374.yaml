shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 18th, 2020.  \nDr. Moshe Hoffman is a Research Scientist\
  \ at MIT Media Lab & Lecturer at Harvard's Department of Economics. He applies game\
  \ theory, models of learning and evolution, and experimental methods, to try to\
  \ decipher the (often subconscious and subtle) incentives that shape our social\
  \ behavior, preferences, and ideologies. Dr. Hoffman obtained his Ph.D. in Economics\
  \ from the University of Chicago, Booth School of Business and his B.S. in Economics\
  \ from the University of Chicago. He also co-designed and teaches \"Game Theory\
  \ and Social Behavior\" which lays out a lot of the evidence and models behind this\
  \ approach.\n\nThis is my third talk with Dr. Hoffman, where we talk about social\
