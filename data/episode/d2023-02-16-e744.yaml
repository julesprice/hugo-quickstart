shownotes: '<p>Dr. Sander van der Linden is Professor of Social Psychology in the
  Department of Psychology at the University of Cambridge and Director of the Cambridge
  Social Decision-Making Lab. He is the author of Foolproof: Why Misinformation Infects
  Our Minds and How to Build Immunity.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on Foolproof. We start by distinguishing misinformation
  from disinformation, and then discuss if misinformation is on the rise, and if it
  spreads easier online. We talk about the psychological mechanisms that make us susceptible
  to it, and demographic data. We discuss if the brain is Bayesian, and if intelligent
  and more educated people are more susceptible to misinformation. We talk about conspiratorial
  thinking. We discuss debunking and prebunking, and which of them works better. We
  talk about social media, echo chambers and filter bubbles, who spreads misinformation
  the most, and if it influences political behavior. Finally, we talk about how to
  inoculate people against misinformation.</p>
