  \ We first go through the ten aspects. We then talk about the personality traits\

  \ the behavioral genetics of personality, the neuroscience of it, and the changes\
  \ in personality that occur across the lifespan. In the latter part of the conversation,\
  \ Dr. DeYoung explains his Cybernetic Big Five Theory (CB5T), and a cybernetic theory\
  \ of psychopathology. We also refer to the difficulties in the classification of\
  \ mental disorders.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. DeYoung\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty\
