shownotes: "<p>Dr. Mitch Brown is an instructor and researcher in Psychology at the\
  \ University of Arkansas. His work primarily considers (1) the tradeoffs people\
  \ invoke to avoid disease and belong to groups, (2) the prioritization of physical\
  \ features and behaviors in shaping preferences for short-term and long-term mates,\
  \ and (3) how inferences of men\u2019s formidability inform stereotypes of personality\
  \ and social functions.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about topics in evolutionary\
  \ psychology. We start with the evolution of pathogen avoidance behaviors. We discuss\
  \ the physical features that men and women look for in a potential partner, and\
  \ the information regarding personality and motivational states people derive from\
  \ facial and bodily features. We talk about humor styles, focusing on aggressive\
  \ and self-defeating humor, and the personality traits of people who use them. Other\
  \ topics include: the relationship between formidability and political militancy\
  \ and moral foundations; limbal rings; and mom and dad bods, and parenting ability.</p>\n"
