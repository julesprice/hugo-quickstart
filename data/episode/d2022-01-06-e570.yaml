shownotes: '<p>Dr. Brian Knutson is a Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at
  Stanford University. His research focuses on the neural basis of emotional experience
  and expression.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about affective neuroscience. We start by discussing
  what it is, and the kinds of questions it deals with. We talk about affect, emotions,
  and what they correspond to in the brain. We discuss if is makes sense to distinguish
  between emotions and feelings. We talk about the areas in the brain that play a
  role in emotion processing. We discuss the role emotions play in decision-making.
  We talk about how affect influences preferences and beliefs. We ask if emotions
  vary cross-culturally. We then get into aspects related to financial decisions,
  including the relationship between future self-continuity and savings, financial
  risk-taking, and gain and loss learning. We discuss if there are individual differences
  in these domains, and if economic decisions vary across the lifespan. Finally, we
  talk about what neuroscience adds to the picture of psychology and economics.</p>
