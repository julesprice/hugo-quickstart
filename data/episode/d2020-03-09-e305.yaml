shownotes: "<p>Dr. Steven Pinker is a Johnstone Family Professor in the Department\
  \ of Psychology at Harvard University. He conducts research on language and cognition,\
  \ writes for publications such as the New York Times, Time and The Atlantic, and\
  \ is the author of ten books, including The Language Instinct, How The Mind Works,\
  \ The Blank Slate, The Stuff of Thought, The Better Angels of Our Nature, The Sense\
  \ of Style, and most recently, Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science,\
  \ Humanism, and Progress.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk go through some of the\
  \ main topics Dr. Pinker tackles in his work. We start by discussing a new hypothesis\
  \ put forth by Joe Henrich and his collaborators, about the possible influence the\
  \ Catholic Church had on the evolution of our WEIRD psychology and the Enlightenment\
  \ ideas. We then talk about cultural evolution, morality from an evolutionary perspective,\
  \ and human progress. We also address if our folk psychology tracks scientific findings\
  \ on human behavior. We also talk about language, and AI. Finally, we go through\
  \ two questions coming from a patron, about the cognitive niche hypothesis, and\
  \ the WEIRD problem.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Pinker\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty\
