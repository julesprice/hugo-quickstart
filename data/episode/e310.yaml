shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 7th, 2020.  \nDr. Hal Whitehead is Professor in the\
  \ Department of Biology at Dalhousie University. His work focuses mainly on the\
  \ behavior, ecology, population biology and conservation of two species of deep-diving\
  \ whale: the sperm and northern bottlenose. He and his team have ongoing research\
  \ projects on sperm whales in the eastern Pacific (since 1985) and Atlantic (since\
  \ 2004) on northern bottlenose whales off Nova Scotia (since 1998), and on pilot\
  \ whales off Nova Scotia Isince 1998). They spend periods of weeks at sea on board\
  \ ocean-going sailing boats collecting acoustic, visual, photographic, genetic and\
  \ oceanographic data.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about several aspects of whale\
  \ sociality, focusing on the ones Dr. Whitehouse studies the most, like the sperm\
  \ whale, the northern bottlenose whale, and the pilot whale. We discuss parental\
  \ investment, alloparenting, and menopause. We talk about how their social networks\
  \ are established, and how they relate to their culture. We address whale culture\
  \ in general, and also how they have cumulative culture, and some examples of gene-culture\
  \ coevolution in whales and dolphins. Finally, we refer to whale conservation.\n\
