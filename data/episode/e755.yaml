shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 1st 2023.  \nDr. Alexandra Kalev is Associate Professor\
  \ of Sociology and Anthropology at Tel Aviv University. She is developing an evidence-based\
  \ approach to managing diversity in corporations and universities. She is the author,\
  \ together with Frank Dobbin, of Getting to Diversity: What Works and What Doesn't.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on Getting to Diversity. We start by discussing what\
  \ a diversity program is, and its different types. We talk about bias. We discuss\
  \ if current diversity programs work. We get into harassment training programs,\
  \ and discuss if diversity programs can backfire, and if they can get rigged. We\
  \ talk about how to keep track of progress. We talk about targeted recruitment programs.\
  \ We discuss the role of mentoring, teams, and employee resource groups. We discuss\
  \ which types of training work best, and how they can be democratized. We also talk\
  \ about work-life struggles, and the role of diversity managers. Finally, we summarize\
  \ the principles that make diversity programs work.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
