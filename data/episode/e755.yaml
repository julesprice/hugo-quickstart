  <p>In this episode, we focus on Getting to Diversity. We start by discussing what
  a diversity program is, and its different types. We talk about bias. We discuss
  if current diversity programs work. We get into harassment training programs, and
  discuss if diversity programs can backfire, and if they can get rigged. We talk
  about how to keep track of progress. We talk about targeted recruitment programs.
  We discuss the role of mentoring, teams, and employee resource groups. We discuss
  which types of training work best, and how they can be democratized. We also talk
  about work-life struggles, and the role of diversity managers. Finally, we summarize
  the principles that make diversity programs work.</p>
