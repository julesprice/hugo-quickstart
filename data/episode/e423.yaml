shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 18th 2020.  \nDr. Andrew Delton is Associate Professor\
  \ in the Department of Political Science and the Center for Behavioral Political\
  \ Economy at Stony Brook University. His research is at the intersection of political\
  \ science, evolutionary psychology, and behavioral economics. Topics include collective\
  \ action and public goods, generosity and redistribution, voting and political mobilization,\
  \ partisanship, risk and time preferences, and emotions such as anger, compassion,\
  \ and shame. Methods include behavioral economic games, population-based surveys,\
  \ decision making tasks, implicit social cognition measures, game theoretic analysis,\
  \ agent-based simulations, and cross-cultural data collection.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about political science through an evolutionary lens. We go through topics\
  \ like welfare tradeoffs from an evolutionary perspective; the welfare state, and\
  \ when people are for and against it; the emotion of compassion, and the role it\
  \ plays in politics; free riding on public goods, and how people deal with free\
  \ riders; partisanship, and voting behavior; and economic redistribution. Toward\
  \ the end, we talk about the insights evolutionary psychology brings to political\
  \ science.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:52  Welfare tradeoffs, compassion, and support for\
