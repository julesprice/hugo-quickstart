shownotes: '<p>In this episode, we talk about political science through an evolutionary
  lens. We go through topics like welfare tradeoffs from an evolutionary perspective;
  the welfare state, and when people are for and against it; the emotion of compassion,
  and the role it plays in politics; free riding on public goods, and how people deal
  with free riders; partisanship, and voting behavior; and economic redistribution.
  Toward the end, we talk about the insights evolutionary psychology brings to political
  science.</p>
