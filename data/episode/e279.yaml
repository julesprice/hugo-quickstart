shownotes: "<p>Dr. Daniel Lieberman is Edwin M. Lerner II Professor of Biological\
  \ Sciences, Professor of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. He studies\
  \ and teaches how and why the human body looks and functions the way it does. He\
  \ started his career studying the evolution of the human head, but is now more focused\
  \ on the evolution of human physical activity, and how evolutionary approaches to\
  \ activities such as walking and running, as well as changes to our body\u2019s\
  \ environments (such as wearing shoes and being physically inactive) can help better\
  \ prevent and treat musculoskeletal diseases. He\u2019s the author of the books\
  \ The Evolution of the Human Head, and The Story of the Human Body: Evolution, Health,\
  \ and Disease.</p>\n<p>In this episode, the focus of our conversation is the evolution\
  \ of human bipedalism. We talk about the evolutionary pressures behind it, the advantages\
  \ it conferred to humans, the new challenges that it posed, and endurance running.\
  \ In the second part of the interview, we talk about evolutionary mismatch, and\
  \ the types of problems that we exposed our bodies to since the agricultural revolution,\
  \ and the solutions we can develop.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Lieberman\u2019\
