  In this episode, we discuss decision-making processes in humans, as well as some\
  \ important biases and heuristics that affect the ways we think. And we also apply\
  \ this knowledge to how people deal with issues like climate change, medical and\
  \ environmental problems (like vaccines and GMOs), genocide, nuclear power, and\
  \ nuclear weapons. We go through a lot of the basics, talking about how biases and\
  \ heuristics work, slow and fast thinking, and bounded rationality. We then use\
  \ that to discuss risk perception. Finally, we talk about teaching people about\
  \ how their minds work, and also the universality (or lack thereof) of these cognitive\
  \ mechanisms. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:01  How to think about biases and heuristics\
