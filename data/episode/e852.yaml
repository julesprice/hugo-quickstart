  This show is sponsored by Enlites, Learning & Development done differently. Check\
  \ the website here: http://enlites.com/\n\nDr. Oded Galor is Herbert H. Goldberger\
  \ Professor of Economics at Brown University. Dr. Galor has advanced the field of\
  \ Unified Growth Theory. He has contributed to the understanding of the relationship\
  \ between inequality and growth, human evolution, and the process of development,\
  \ demography, and growth, and the role of deep-rooted factors in comparative economic\
  \ development. He is the author of The Journey of Humanity: The Origins of Wealth\
  \ and Inequality.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Journey of Humanity. We talk\
  \ about the two main mysteries addressed in the book: the mystery of growth, and\
  \ the mystery of inequality. We talk about the migration of H. sapiens out of Africa.\
  \ We discuss the Malthusian Trap, and the conditions where it applies. We discuss\
  \ the factors behind the development of agriculture, and why it could be considered\
  \ inevitable. We talk about what impacted human demographics the most across history.\
  \ We talk about Dr. Galor\u2019s Unified Growth Theory. We discuss the factors behind\
  \ the industrial revolution. We talk about the relationship between diversity, innovation,\
  \ and social cohesiveness. We discuss population growth and the Demographic Transition,\
  \ and if we should worry about declining fertility rates. Finally, we address the\
  \ mystery of inequality, why there is inequality across societies, and the future\
  \ of inequality.\n\nTime Links:\n00:00 Intro\n00:46  The mystery of growth\n02:44\
