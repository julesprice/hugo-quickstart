shownotes: "Dr. Thomas Morgan is Assistant Professor in the School of Human Evolution\
  \ and Social Change at Arizona State University. His background is in the evolution\
  \ of animal social behavior and cognition. He graduated from Cambridge with a bachelor's\
  \ in zoology in 2009, focusing on vertebrate evolution and behavioral ecology. He\
  \ completed his doctorate in 2013 at the University of St. Andrews working with\
  \ Kevin Laland to carry out a series of experiments testing evolutionary hypotheses\
  \ about human social learning. From 2014 to 2016, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow\
  \ with Tom Griffiths in the computational cognitive science lab at University of\
  \ California at Berkeley where he developed a new platform for large-scale online\
  \ social experiments called Dallinger. He joined the Adaptation, Behavior, Culture\
  \ and Society group at Arizona State Unviersity in August 2016. He\u2019s interested\
  \ in the psychological mechanisms that support culture and evolutionary explanations\
  \ for how humans came to be. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about cultural evolution.\
  \ First, we discuss how we study the cognitive mechanisms that provide a biological\
  \ basis for culture, and the relationship between biology and culture. We then get\
  \ into Dr. Morgan\u2019s work on conformist transmission, and sex differences in\
  \ conformity and where they stem from. We also talk about the chicken-and-egg problem\
  \ of culture, and issues with sociocultural constructionist approaches, and cross-cultural\
  \ variation. Finally, we discuss what we can learn by studying other species, and\
  \ about how peculiar is cumulative culture in the animal realm. \n\nTime Links:\
