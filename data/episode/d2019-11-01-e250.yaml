  s book, A Savage Order. We talk about different types of political violence, and\
  \ how they interrelate, including what Dr. Kleinfeld calls \u201Cprivilege violence\u201D\
  , and we refer to how violence against blacks was legitimized in the US after the\
  \ civil war. We also discuss the decivilizing process, dirty deals, and the recivilizing\
  \ process and why the middle class is so important in the latter. Toward the end,\
  \ we also talk about the policies adopted in Georgia to systemically fighting against\
  \ corruption, and also why we have to go beyond culture to understand violence,\
  \ and also to deal with current political issues like mass migration, multiculturalism,\
  \ and Islam.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Kleinfeld\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Carnegie\
