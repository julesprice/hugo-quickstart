shownotes: "<p>Dr. Paul Katsafanas is Professor of Philosophy and Director of Graduate\
  \ Studies at Boston University. He works on ethics, moral psychology, and nineteenth-century\
  \ philosophy. His latest book is Philosophy of Devotion: The Longing for Invulnerable\
  \ Ideals.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Philosophy of Devotion.\
  \ We start by discussing what devotion is. We talk about the psychological features\
  \ of sacred values; psychological strategies for treating commitments and fixed\
  \ and immutable; and the connection between sacred values and devotion. We discuss\
  \ a connection between devotion and nihilism, and we get into different accounts\
  \ of fanaticism. Finally, we talk about how we can hold sacred values and avoid\
  \ fanaticism, through irony, affirmation, and the \u201Cdeepening move\u201D.</p>\n\
