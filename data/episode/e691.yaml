  \ Faculty of Political Science at the National School for Political Studies and\
  \ Public Administration, Romania. Dr. Umbre\u0219 does research in Social Anthropology,\
  \ Cognitive Science and Evolutionary Psychology. He is the author of Living with\

  \ we focus on Living with Distrust. First, we discuss the role of ethnography, and\
  \ how it is done scientifically. We get into the village of Sateni, the focus the\
  \ book, and the most interesting aspects of its people\u2019s sociality. We talk\
  \ about the household, trust among kin, how kinship is determined, and what we can\
  \ learn about social relationships in mortuary rituals. We also talk about politics\
  \ in a context of social fragmentation. We discuss how trust is established and\
  \ maintained, and when distrust is a reasonable strategy. Finally, we get into how\
  \ a society can function on the basis of strategic and circumstantial relationships,\
  \ and what we can learn about human cooperation and morality from this ethnography.\n\
