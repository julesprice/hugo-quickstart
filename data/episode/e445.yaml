shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 28th 2020.  \nKate\u0159ina Lochmanov\xE1 is currently\
  \ finishing her postgraduate studies of philosophy at the University of Ostrava,\
  \ where she graduated with a diploma thesis entitled Iracionality of a Wager on\
  \ Life in the Context of Benatar\u2019s Antinatalism. She is one of the coorganisators\
  \ of conferences on antinatalism in Ostrava as well as in Prague (with Vlastimil\
  \ Voh\xE1nka, Filip Svoboda, David \u010Cern\xFD and Tom\xE1\u0161 H\u0159\xEDbek).\
  \ At present, she is primarily concerned with geometry and metaphysics of space\
  \ by a German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, but peripherally she is still\
  \ interested in the subject of antinatalism too, especially in (the history of)\
  \ Benatar\u2019s asymmetry argument. She is the editor of History of Antinatalism:\
  \ How Philosophy Has Challenged the Question of Procreation.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on History of Antinatalism, and aspects of its philosophy. We start with\
  \ the history, and then get into topics like the philosophy of Schopenhauer and\
  \ David Benatar; the human condition; promortalism; abortion; human extinction;\
  \ pronatalism; homicide; euthanasia; and nihilism.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
