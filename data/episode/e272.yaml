shownotes: "<p>Dr. Peter S. Ungar is Distinguished Professor of Anthropology and Director\
  \ of Environmental Dynamics at the University of Arkansas. His research focuses\
  \ on paleoecology and teeth. He\u2019s the author of books like Mammal Teeth, Evolution\u2019\
  s Bite, and of textbooks like Human Diet: Its Origin and Evolution.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we focus on the evolution of teeth. We discuss how anthropologists study\
  \ teeth and how they are used. We address the important distinction between what\
  \ an animal can eat and the types of foods it has available. We talk a little bit\
  \ about the evolutionary origins of teeth. Dr. Ungar refers to the study of tartar,\
  \ that began very recently. We also talk about how we can reconstruct diets and\
  \ environments from teeth. We then refer to the evolutionary mismatch posed by our\
  \ modern human diets, and the kinds of oral health problems that derive from that.\
  \ In the end, we also talk about the problems with arguments coming from veganism\
  \ and the paleo diet about our diets.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Ungar\u2019\
