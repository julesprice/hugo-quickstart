shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 8th 2023.  \nDr. Jared Rubin is Professor of Economics\
  \ and Co-Director of the Institute for the Study of Religion, Economics, and Society\
  \ at Chapman University. Dr. Rubin is an economic historian interested in the political\
  \ and religious economies of the Middle East and Western Europe. His research focuses\
  \ on historical relationships between political and religious institutions and their\
  \ role in economic development. He is the author, together with Mark Koyama, of\
  \ How the World Became Rich: The Historical Origins of Economic Growth.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on How the World Became Rich. We start by talking about how\
  \ rich the world is now, and we also define economic growth. We then go through\
  \ different explanations for sustained economic growth, including geography, institutions,\
  \ culture, demographics, and colonization. We also discuss technology, and ethnic\
  \ homogeneity. In regards to colonization, we discuss the impact it had both on\
  \ the economies of the colonizer and the colonized countries. We talk about how\
  \ sustained economic growth was possible in northwestern Europe, and what led to\
  \ the British industrial revolution. We talk about why China did not get there first.\
  \ Finally, we discuss some of the drawbacks to economic growth, including climate\
  \ change, deadly weapons, and economic inequality.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
