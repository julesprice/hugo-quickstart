shownotes: "<p>Dr. Greger Larson is a Professor in the School of Archaeology at the\
  \ University of Oxford and Director of the Wellcome Trust Palaeogenomics and Bio-Archaeology\
  \ Research Network (PaleoBARN). His research interests include evolutionary genomics,\
  \ ancient DNA, domestication, human and animal\ndispersal, and phylogenetics. His\
  \ work on the domestication of canines and the origin of the domestic dog has provided\
  \ insights into the prehistoric bond\nbetween humans and early dogs.</p>\n<p>\_\
  </p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about the study of animal domestication. We start\
  \ by discussing if we know exactly when it started, and go through sources of evidence\
  \ like genetics and archaeology. We talk about the impact of animal domestication\
  \ on human evolution. We discuss issues with how we think about domestication and\
  \ the supposed intentionality behind it, and how we should think about the early\
  \ stages of our relationship with other animal species. We talk about the study\
  \ of the timing of human dispersal through animal domestication. Finally, we discuss\
  \ the main challenges of studying animal domestication.</p>\n"
