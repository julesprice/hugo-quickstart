shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 27th 2023.  \nDr. Greger Larson is a Professor in the\
  \ School of Archaeology at the University of Oxford and Director of the Wellcome\
  \ Trust Palaeogenomics and Bio-Archaeology Research Network (PaleoBARN). His research\
  \ interests include evolutionary genomics, ancient DNA, domestication, human and\
  \ animal dispersal, and phylogenetics. His work on the domestication of canines\
  \ and the origin of the domestic dog has provided insights into the prehistoric\
  \ bond between humans and early dogs.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the study\
  \ of animal domestication. We start by discussing if we know exactly when it started,\
  \ and go through sources of evidence like genetics and archaeology. We talk about\
  \ the impact of animal domestication on human evolution. We discuss issues with\
  \ how we think about domestication and the supposed intentionality behind it, and\
  \ how we should think about the early stages of our relationship with other animal\
  \ species. We talk about the study of the timing of human dispersal through animal\
  \ domestication. Finally, we discuss the main challenges of studying animal domestication.\n\
