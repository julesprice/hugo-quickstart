  \ Be a Stoic.</p>\n<p>In today\u2019s episode, we talk about how we can demarcate\
  \ pseudoscience from science. We go more specifically into certain criteria, like\
  \ falsifiability, predictability, explicability, and replicability; the distinction\
  \ between pseudoscience and anti-science; and we also discuss if science, in the\
  \ end, is a cultural construct, though not as the postmoderns would have it. &nbsp;</p>\n\
