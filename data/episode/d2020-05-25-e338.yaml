  s the author of a new book, Perfectly Confident: How To Calibrate Your Decisions\
  \ Wisely.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Dr. Moore\u2019s new book, and talk\
  \ about confidence, overconfidence, and underconfidence. We also refer to the above-average\
  \ effect, ambiguity aversion and risk aversion, overprecision, and the different\
  \ kinds of overconfidence and underconfidence. Finally, we discuss the relationship\
  \ between confidence and decision-making and emotions, and the ways by which we\
  \ can try to calibrate our decisions wisely, applying it to business, politics,\
  \ and personal relationships.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Moore\u2019s work:</p>\n\
