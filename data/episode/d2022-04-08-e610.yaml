shownotes: "<p>Dr. Dorothea Debus is Professor of Theoretical Philosophy at Konstanz\
  \ University, with a special focus on the philosophy of language and the philosophy\
  \ of mind. Her main area of research is the Philosophy of Mind. A substantial part\
  \ of her published work is concerned with the mental phenomenon of memory; but she\
  \ has also written on various other mental phenomena \u2013 imagination, attention,\
  \ perception and the emotions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about philosophy\
  \ of memory, and mental self-regulation. We start with a brief introduction to the\
  \ questions explored in philosophy of mind and, more specifically, in the philosophy\
  \ of memory. We get specifically into how we remember the past; the cognitive differences\
  \ between remembering the past and imagining the future; how we understand the concept\
  \ of the past; the causal theory of memory; and past-directed emotions, their role\
  \ and epistemic value. We also discuss mental self-regulation.</p>\n"
