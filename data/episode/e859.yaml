  \ century. We then talk about the Great Rationality Debate, and discuss topics like\
  \ biases and heuristics, ecological rationality, and relevance realization. We also\
  \ discuss whether rationality is mostly an individual or a social phenomenon, whether\
  \ the rationality debate might have daily life applications, and the current state\
  \ and future of the debate.</p>\n"
