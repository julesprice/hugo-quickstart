shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 31st 2023.  \nAnna Riedl is a cognitive scientist,\
  \ specialized in rational decision-making. She is an active public speaker and science\
  \ communicator. She was a researcher at the Viennese Institute for Artificial Intelligence\
  \ and Decision Support. Anna is also a member of the Global Shapers Community organized\
  \ by the World Economic Forum and served as curator for the Vienna Hub.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we start by talking about Anna\u2019s Historical Map of (the) Cognitive\
  \ Science(s) project. We discuss what counts as cognitive science, and go through\
  \ some of the big theories and paradigms in cognitive science from the 19th century\
  \ to the 21st century. We then talk about the Great Rationality Debate, and discuss\
  \ topics like biases and heuristics, ecological rationality, and relevance realization.\
  \ We also discuss whether rationality is mostly an individual or a social phenomenon,\
  \ whether the rationality debate might have daily life applications, and the current\
  \ state and future of the debate.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:38  A Historical\
