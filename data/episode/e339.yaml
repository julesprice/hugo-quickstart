shownotes: "<p>Dr. Shaun Nichols is Professor in the Sage School of Philosophy at\
  \ Cornell University. He works in philosophy of cognitive science. Most of his research\
  \ concerns the psychological foundations of philosophical thought. Recently he\u2019\
  s been drawing on learning theory to try to understand how people acquire philosophically\
  \ significant concepts and distinctions, especially in the domain of morality.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about morality. We approach it from a philosophical\
  \ and scientific perspective. We discuss the role that emotions and other mental\
  \ mechanisms play. We also refer to child development, learning, and human universals\
  \ and the folk psychology of morality. Then, we talk about psychopathy and moral\
  \ rationalism; the link between morality and violence; and the is-ought dichotomy.\
  \ Finally, we discuss a possible new kind of moral realism.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow\
