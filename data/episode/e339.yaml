shownotes: "RECORDED ON April 15th, 2020.  \nDr. Shaun Nichols is Professor in the\
  \ Sage School of Philosophy at Cornell University. He works in philosophy of cognitive\
  \ science. Most of his research concerns the psychological foundations of philosophical\
  \ thought. Recently he\u2019s been drawing on learning theory to try to understand\
  \ how people acquire philosophically significant concepts and distinctions, especially\
  \ in the domain of morality.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about morality. We approach\
  \ it from a philosophical and scientific perspective. We discuss the role that emotions\
  \ and other mental mechanisms play. We also refer to child development, learning,\
  \ and human universals and the folk psychology of morality. Then, we talk about\
  \ psychopathy and moral rationalism; the link between morality and violence; and\
  \ the is-ought dichotomy. Finally, we discuss a possible new kind of moral realism.\n\
