shownotes: "<p>Dr. Marco Del Giudice is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology\
  \ at the University of New Mexico. In his work he explores a wide range of topics\
  \ at the intersection of human behavior, evolution, and development. His approach\
  \ is interdisciplinary and driven by the quest for theoretical synthesis. Over the\
  \ years he has developed some broad, integrative models: the Adaptive Calibration\
  \ Model of individual differences in stress responsivity (with Bruce Ellis and Birdie\
  \ Shirtcliff); an evolutionary-developmental model of sex differences in attachment\
  \ styles; and a unifying life history framework for evolutionary psychopathology.\
  \ Most of his current empirical work is devoted to testing, advancing, and refining\
  \ these models with a variety of research methods. He\u2019s the author of Evolutionary\
  \ Psychopathology: A Unified Approach.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we go through the\
  \ main topics of Dr. Del Giudice\u2019s book, Evolutionary Psychopathology. He explains\
  \ what the field is about, and hos its approach differs from more traditional/mainstream\
  \ ones in psychiatry and clinical psychology. Then we get into topics related to\
  \ human development, like the canalization of developmental processes, motivational\
  \ systems, and attachment styles. We also talk about behavioral genetics and differential\
  \ susceptibility. Dr. Del Giudice explains the central approach to a new system\
  \ of classification for mental disorders that he exposes in the book, the fast-slow-defense\
  \ model (FSD). Toward the end, we also discuss the several different difficulties\
  \ in classifying mental disorders.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Del Giudice\u2019\
