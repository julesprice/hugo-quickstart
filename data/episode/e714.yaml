shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 29th 2022.  \nDr. Robert Cialdini is Professor Emeritus\
  \ of Psychology at Arizona State University. He has spent his entire career researching\
  \ the science of influence, earning him an international reputation as an expert\
  \ in the fields of persuasion, compliance and prosocial behavior. He is the author\
  \ of Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, a New York Times No. 1 bestseller,\
  \ now in its third edition with over 5 million copies sold worldwide, and in over\
  \ 40 languages.\n\nIn this episode, focus on Influence. We talk a bit about the\
  \ psychology of compliance, and go through the seven principles of persuasion: reciprocation,\
  \ liking, social proof, authority, scarcity, commitment and consistency, and unity.\
  \ We talk about how Dr. Cialdini got at these principles. We discuss if there could\
  \ be more principles, if they apply in any social context, if any of them is more\
  \ important than the others, and what their goals are. Finally, we talk about how\
  \ to learn and apply the principles, and how we can protect ourselves from manipulation\
  \ and deception.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:27  The psychology of compliance\
