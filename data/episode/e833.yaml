  \ talk about dynamical approaches in cognitive science. We start by discussing the\
  \ differences between computational-representational approaches and dynamical approaches\
  \ in cognitive science. We talk about 4E cognition. We then get into a recent paper\
  \ by Dr. Hip\xF3lito, Mind as Motion, and talk about a shift in psychology towards\
  \ dynamical approaches, and the role of the sociocultural context. We discuss if\
  \ psychological experiences have any intrinsic value, and if science is independent\
  \ of any sociocultural context. Finally, we discuss if AI systems can become human-like\
  \ if they are not embodied.</p>\n"
