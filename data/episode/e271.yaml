shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 10th, 2019.  \nDr. Alice H. Eagly is Emerita Professor\
  \ of Psychology and of Management and Organizations at Northwestern University.\
  \ She currently holds the James Padilla Chair for Arts and Sciences and a Faculty\
  \ Fellowship for the Institute of Policy Research at Northwestern University. Her\
  \ primary research contributions have been in the area of social psychology, as\
  \ well as personality psychology and Industrial Organizational Psychology. Her research\
  \ interests include the psychology of gender, especially sex differences and similarities\
  \ in leadership, prosocial behavior, aggression, partner preferences, and sociopolitical\
  \ attitudes. She\u2019s also interested in the content of stereotypes; social role\
  \ theory as a theory of sex differences and similarities and of the origins of sex\
  \ differences in social behavior; and attitude theory and research, especially attitudinal\
  \ selectivity in information processing.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the psychology\
  \ of gender, and the several different approaches to it. We first talk about some\
  \ of the most well-established sex differences and their origins. We refer to the\
  \ nature-nurture debate, and Dr. Eagly\u2019s social role theory. We then go through\
  \ some of what Dr. Eagly thinks are the limitations of the approaches from evolutionary\
  \ psychology and social constructionism, while also addressing the gender equality\
  \ paradox. We then discuss feminist issues, namely how feminism should deal with\
  \ sex differences; what is gender equality (and the issue with quotas); female leadership;\
  \ how gender stereotypes have changed over time; and the future of gender equality.\n\
