  \ distinguishing implicit bias, explicit bias, and overt behavior; how stereotypes\
  \ affect people\u2019s behavior; some interesting approaches to changing people\u2019\
  s stereotypes, and prevent discriminatory behavior. In the final segment of the\
  \ interview, we also discuss the science reform movement, and some of the reasons\
  \ behind the replicability crisis in science.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:35\
