shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 9th 2022.  \nDr. Batja Mesquita is Distinguished\
  \ Professor of Psychology at the University of Leuven, Belgium, where she studies\
  \ the role of culture in emotions, and of emotions in culture and society. She is\
  \ director of the Center for Social and Cultural Psychology in Leuven. She is the\
  \ author of Between Us: How Cultures Create Emotions.\n\nIn this episode, we focus\
  \ on Between Us. We start by talking about what emotions are, and their functions.\
  \ We discuss how people think about and categorize emotions, and the MINE (Mental,\
  \ Inside, Essentialist) and OURS (Outside, Relational, Situational) models of emotions,\
  \ and their relationship with wellbeing. We talk about raising children cross-culturally,\
  \ and attachment styles. We go through a few emotions, like anger and shame, and\
  \ love and happiness, how they manifest across cultures, and ask if love is at the\
  \ basis of all intimate relationships, and if everyone cares about happiness. We\
  \ talk about how language relates to emotion, and the developmental aspects associated\
  \ with emotion acquisition. We discuss the applications of research on emotion,\
  \ and how emotions also make culture. Finally, we talk about the work of Paul Ekman,\
  \ evolutionary approaches to emotion, \u201Cbasic emotions\u201D, and the valence\
  \ of emotions.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:39  What are emotions?  \n05:01\
