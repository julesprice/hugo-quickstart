  \ University of Leuven, Belgium, where she studies the role of culture in emotions,\
  \ and of emotions in culture and society. She is director of the Center for Social\
  \ and Cultural Psychology in Leuven. She is the author of Between Us: How Cultures\
  \ Create Emotions.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Between Us. We start by\
  \ talking about what emotions are, and their functions. We discuss how people think\
  \ about and categorize emotions, and the MINE (Mental, Inside, Essentialist) and\
  \ OURS (Outside, Relational, Situational) models of emotions, and their relationship\
  \ with wellbeing. We talk about raising children cross-culturally. We go through\
  \ a few emotions, like anger and shame, and love and happiness, how they manifest\
  \ across cultures, and ask if love is at the basis of all intimate relationships,\
  \ and if everyone cares about happiness. We talk about how language relates to emotion,\
  \ and the developmental aspects associated with emotion acquisition. We discuss\
  \ the applications of research on emotion. Finally, we talk about the work of Paul\
  \ Ekman, evolutionary approaches to emotion, and \u201Cbasic emotions\u201D.</p>\n"
