  \ Mercy. Dr. Hill received her Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from Tulane University.\
  \ She teaches courses in research methods, statistics, biopsychology, and gender\
  \ differences. Her primary areas of research interest and activity focus on evolutionary\
  \ and comparative psychology. She has investigated the interaction between biological\
  \ and environmental factors in risk-taking behavior. In this research, she used\
  \ evolutionary theory related to parental investment and life history strategies\
  \ to conceptualize environmental factors, especially the impact of an unpredictable\
  \ family environment. The areas of impulsivity, risky drinking and risk taking have\
  \ been of most interest. She joined the University of Detroit Mercy faculty in 1997\
  \ and holds the position of Professor of Psychology. Hill also serves as the chair\
  \ of the Detroit Mercy Institutional Review Board (IRB).\n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ talk about life history theory, its application to humans, and understanding the\
  \ development of risky behavior. First, Dr. Hill tells us what life history theory\
  \ is about, and issues with individual differences in how people are susceptible\
  \ to different environments. Then, we get into what are unpredictable environments,\
  \ and the development of risky behavior.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:07  Life history theory\
