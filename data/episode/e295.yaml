shownotes: "<p>Dr. David Benatar is professor of philosophy at the University of Cape\
  \ Town in Cape Town, South Africa. He is best known for his advocacy of anti-natalism\
  \ in his book Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence, in which\
  \ he argues that coming into existence is a serious harm, regardless of the feelings\
  \ of the existing being once brought into existence, and that, as a consequence,\
  \ it is always morally wrong to create more sentient beings. He\u2019s also the\
  \ author of books like The Second Sexism: Discrimination Against Men and Boys (2012),\
  \ and The Human Predicament: A Candid Guide to Life's Biggest Questions (2017).</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we focus on The Second Sexism. We first go through some concepts,\
  \ definition and clarifications. Dr. Benatar distinguishes between the first and\
  \ the second sexism, and also between disadvantages and wrongful discrimination.\
  \ We then address several domains where there is wrongful discrimination against\
  \ men, like violence and sexual assault, family laws, education, military service,\
  \ imprisonment and crime sentences, and circumcision. We also discuss social stereotypes\
  \ about men and women, and where behavioral differences come from, and if they are\
  \ ethically relevant. We also talk about how misleading the term \u201Cgender violence\u201D\
  \ is, and in any ways some arguments put forth by feminists against the second sexism\
  \ are wrong. We specifically address the arguments Dr. Benatar names as the inversion\
  \ argument, the costs-of-dominance argument, and the distraction argument. Finally,\
  \ we ask if feminism can discriminate against men, or at least exacerbate some of\
  \ the already existent discrimination, and also what we could do to tackle the second\
  \ sexism, at a political, social, and cultural level.</p>\n"
