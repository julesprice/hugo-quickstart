shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 5th, 2019.  \nDr. David Benatar is professor of philosophy\
  \ at the University of Cape Town in Cape Town, South Africa. He is best known for\
  \ his advocacy of anti-natalism in his book Better Never to Have Been: The Harm\
  \ of Coming into Existence, in which he argues that coming into existence is a serious\
  \ harm, regardless of the feelings of the existing being once brought into existence,\
  \ and that, as a consequence, it is always morally wrong to create more sentient\
  \ beings. He\u2019s also the author of books like The Second Sexism: Discrimination\
  \ Against Men and Boys (2012), and The Human Predicament: A Candid Guide to Life's\
  \ Biggest Questions (2017).\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Second Sexism. We\
  \ first go through some concepts, definitions and clarifications. Dr. Benatar distinguishes\
  \ between the first and the second sexism, and also between disadvantages and wrongful\
  \ discrimination. We then address several domains where there is wrongful discrimination\
  \ against men, like violence and sexual assault, family laws, education, military\
  \ service, imprisonment and crime sentences, and circumcision. We also discuss social\
  \ stereotypes about men and women, and where behavioral differences come from, and\
  \ if they are ethically relevant. We also talk about how misleading the term \u201C\
  gender violence\u201D is, and in any ways some arguments put forth by feminists\
  \ against the second sexism are wrong. We specifically address the arguments Dr.\
  \ Benatar names as the inversion argument, the costs-of-dominance argument, and\
  \ the distraction argument. Finally, we ask if feminism can discriminate against\
  \ men, or at least exacerbate some of the already existent discrimination, and also\
  \ what we could do to tackle the second sexism, at a political, social, and cultural\
  \ level.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n00:53  The first and the second sexisms  \n03:38  Disadvantage,\
