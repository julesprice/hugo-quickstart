  <p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about 19th-century German philosophy, and\
  \ abolitionism in the US. We discuss what characterizes German philosophy, particularly\
  \ the topic of subjectivism. We get into Hegel\u2019s philosophy, and his work on\
  \ aesthetics and the arts, tragedy and comedy, and modern subjectivity in art. We\
  \ talk about Hegel and Marx, and their views on capitalism, society, and poverty.\
  \ We discuss how 19th-century philosophers took laughter seriously. Finally, we\
  \ talk about abolitionism in the US, the work of Lydia Maria Child, and we discuss\
  \ what we should make of politically motivated philosophy.</p>\n"
