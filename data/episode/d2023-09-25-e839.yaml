  \ we focus on A Theory of Everyone. We begin with the premise of the book, and what\
  \ a \u201Ctheory of everyone\u201D is. We talk about four laws of life: energy,\
  \ innovation, cooperation, and evolution. We discuss how cooperation expands in\
  \ human societies, and what distinguishes us from other animals. We talk about intelligence\
  \ and IQ, and the collective brain and the idea of \u201Cgenius\u201D. We discuss\
  \ the importance of institutions and cultural norms, and the role of ideas. We talk\
  \ about multiculturalism, and how to solve the \u201Cparadox of diversity\u201D\
  . We discuss our current energy ceiling, and the problems that derive from it and\
  \ how to solve them. Finally, we talk about the challenges of studying human behavior\
  \ cross-culturally.</p>\n"
