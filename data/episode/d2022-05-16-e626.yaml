shownotes: "<p>Dr. Tanisha Fazal is a Professor of Political Science at the University\
  \ of Minnesota. Her research and teaching focus on sovereignty, international law,\
  \ medical care in conflict zones, and armed conflict. From 2021\u20132023, she is\
  \ also an Andrew Carnegie Fellow. She is the author of State Death: The Politics\
  \ and Geography of Conquest, Occupation, and Annexation; and Wars of Law: Unintended\
  \ Consequences in the Regulation of Armed Conflict.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we\
  \ focus on Wars of Law. We talk about the history of laws of war, and particularly\
  \ declarations of war and peace treaties. We discuss their goals, the perverse incentives\
  \ they introduce, their effects on rates of war initiation, who are their framers,\
  \ and their biases. We talk about how rebel groups engage with them, and people\
  \ that should be included in the future. We discuss several problems with Pinker\u2019\
  s decline-of-war thesis. Finally, we ask if laws of war disincentivize or try to\
  \ eliminate war.</p>\n"
