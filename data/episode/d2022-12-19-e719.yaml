  <p>In this episode, we focus on Ritual. We first ask what is a ritual, and how common
  it is. We talk about the functions of rituals, and how they relate to meaning. We
  discuss the hypothesis that rituals drove the evolution of civilization. We talk
  about the individual and social benefits of rituals, and causal opacity as a feature
  of rituals. We discuss modes of religiosity theory, and get into fire-walking rituals,
  and the psychological effects of costly rituals. We also talk about the relationship
  between ritual and sexual selection, and the role that drugs play in some rituals.
  Finally, we discuss the benefits and obstacles to an interdisciplinary approach
  in the social sciences.</p>
