shownotes: "<p>Dr. Bear F. Braumoeller is a Professor in the Department of Political\
  \ Science at Ohio State University. He previously held faculty positions at Harvard\
  \ University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Dr. Braumoeller\u2019\
  s research is in the areas of international security and computational social science.\
  \ His current research focus is on the relationship between international order\
  \ and international conflict. He is the author Only the Dead: The Persistence of\
  \ War in the Modern Age (Oxford University Press, 2019).</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we focus on Only the Dead. We first address some basic questions, like the definition\
  \ of war, when war started in human history, and the causes of war and how they\
  \ changed over time. We talk about how to measure rates of conflict initiation,\
  \ and magnitude, severity and intensity of war. We then get into the decline-of-war\
  \ thesis, particularly the version put forth by Steven Pinker, and go through some\
  \ of the main issues with it, at the level of data and explanations. We also talk\
  \ about what it gets right. Finally, we ask if wars are irrational, and discuss\
  \ why the decline-of-war thesis might be politically dangerous.</p>\n"
