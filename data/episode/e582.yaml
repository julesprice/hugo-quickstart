shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 13th 2021.  \nDr. Mary Beth Willard is an Associate\
  \ Professor of Philosophy at Weber State University. She received her Ph.D. from\
  \ Yale University and writes primarily in aesthetics and blogs at aestheticsforbirds.com.\
  \ She is the author of Why It\u2019s OK to Enjoy the Work of Immoral Artists.\n\n\
  In this episode, we focus on Why It\u2019s OK to Enjoy the Work of Immoral Artists.\
  \ We first discuss how aesthetic questions might relate to ethical ones. We then\
  \ ask if art can itself be immoral. We discuss the complicated questions of how\
  \ and when the work of an artist should be condemned. We talk about the #metoo movement,\
  \ cancel culture, and the presumption of guilt. We get into how people should feel\
  \ about being influenced by immoral artists. We discuss if it matters that people\
  \ differ in their moral tastes. After focusing on artists and consumers, we also\
  \ mention platforms. Finally, we talk about ethical consumption in other domains.\
