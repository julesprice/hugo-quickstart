shownotes: "<p>Dr. Steve Stewart-Williams is Associate Professor of Psychology at\
  \ Nottingham University Malaysia Campus. His research revolves around the idea that\
  \ theories from evolutionary biology can shed light on human psychology. In particular,\
  \ he\u2019s interested in the evolutionary origins of altruistic behavior and human\
  \ sex differences. He also has a long-standing interest in the philosophical implications\
  \ of evolutionary theory. He\u2019s also the author of the books Darwin, God and\
  \ the Meaning of Life (2010) and The Ape That Understood the Universe (2018).</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, our conversation centers on some of the main topics of Dr. Stewart-Williams\u2019\
  \ most recent book, The Ape That Understood the Universe. We first go through some\
  \ of the basics of modern evolutionary theory and evolutionary biology, like units\
  \ and levels of selection, and sexual selection, and also establish the relationship\
  \ between biology and culture at the same time. Then, we discuss the origins of\
  \ sex differences, and psychological traits as part of our phenotype. We also refer\
  \ to the problem with using the term \u201Cgender\u201D in science. We then talk\
  \ about the model MMC (Mutual Mate Choice) in human sexual selection, and if there\
  \ is any preferred mating system in human societies, like monogamy or polygamy.\
  \ Toward the end, we talk about the evolutionary mismatch between our ancestral\
  \ environments and our modern industrialized scientific societies, and how to approach\
  \ the study of religion from a biological/evolutionary standpoint.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n\
