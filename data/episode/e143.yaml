shownotes: "<p>Dr. William von Hippel is Professor of Psychology at the University\
  \ of Queensland, Australia. &nbsp;He has published more than a hundred articles,\
  \ chapters, and edited books in social psychology, and his research has been featured\
  \ in The New York Times, USA Today, The Economist, the BBC, Le Monde, El Mundo,\
  \ Der Spiegel, and The Australian. He also recently published a book, \u201CThe\
  \ Social Leap: The New Evolutionary Science of Who We Are, Where We Come From, and\
  \ What Makes Us Happy\u201D (2018).</p>\n<p>In this episode, we go through the main\
  \ topics of Dr. von Hippel\u2019s book, The Social Leap. We compare humans with\
  \ other animals. We talk about the movement from the rainforest to the savannah;\
  \ the evolution of bipedality and our hands; meat, cooking, and diet; hunting, cooperative\
  \ breeding, and the social brain hypothesis; alloparenting, pair-bonding and monogamy.\
  \ We also refer to Christopher Ryan\u2019s book, Sex at Dawn, and the points where\
  \ his thesis fails. We then go through the importance of language and culture, and\
  \ gene-culture coevolution. We also talk about tribalism, the advent of agriculture,\
  \ and hierarchy and economic, social and sexual inequality, and the problem with\
  \ polygamic societies. Also, the mismatch between the ancestral environments we\
  \ adapted to and the modern ones, and what our innate psychology tells us about\
  \ what makes us happy, even in modern industrialized societies. We finish off by\
  \ talking about a recently paper authored by Dr. von Hippel and Dr. David Buss,\
  \ \u201CPsychological barriers to evolutionary psychology: Ideological bias and\
  \ coalitional adaptations\u201D.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:56 Humans\
