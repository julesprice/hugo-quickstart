shownotes: "Dr. William von Hippel is Professor of Psychology at the University of\
  \ Queensland, Australia.  He has published more than a hundred articles, chapters,\
  \ and edited books in social psychology, and his research has been featured in The\
  \ New York Times, USA Today, The Economist, the BBC, Le Monde, El Mundo, Der Spiegel,\
  \ and The Australian. He also recently published a book, \u201CThe Social Leap:\
  \ The New Evolutionary Science of Who We Are, Where We Come From, and What Makes\
  \ Us Happy\u201D (2018).\n\nIn this episode, we go through the main topics of Dr.\
  \ von Hippel\u2019s book, The Social Leap. We compare humans with other animals.\
  \ We talk about the movement from the rainforest to the savannah; the evolution\
  \ of bipedality and our hands; meat, cooking, and diet; hunting, cooperative breeding,\
  \ and the social brain hypothesis; alloparenting, pair-bonding and monogamy. We\
  \ also refer to Christopher Ryan\u2019s book, Sex at Dawn, and the points where\
  \ his thesis fails. We then go through the importance of language and culture, and\
  \ gene-culture coevolution. We also talk about tribalism, the advent of agriculture,\
  \ and hierarchy and economic, social and sexual inequality, and the problem with\
  \ polygamic societies. Also, the mismatch between the ancestral environments we\
  \ adapted to and the modern ones, and what our innate psychology tells us about\
  \ what makes us happy, even in modern industrialized societies. We finish off by\
  \ talking about a recently paper authored by Dr. von Hippel and Dr. David Buss,\
  \ \u201CPsychological barriers to evolutionary psychology: Ideological bias and\
  \ coalitional adaptations\u201D. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:56  Humans and the Great\
