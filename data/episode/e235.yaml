  \ articles in the fields of psychology, medicine, and evolutionary studies, on subjects\
  \ ranging from human emotions to peer bullying/victimization to Alzheimer\u2019\
  s disease. He received his doctorate in clinical psychology from Suffolk University\
  \ and is currently a postdoctoral fellow at a private practice in Connecticut. His\
  \ dissertation is on the emotional processing function of dreaming.</p>\n<p>Mr.\
  \ Niruban Balachandran was a winner of the World Bank's Innovation Challenge Prize\
  \ and the International Society for Human Ethology's Linda Mealey Award. He is widely\
  \ published in scholarly journals and print media, and is a frequently-invited speaker\
  \ at international conferences. He is a Master of Public Administration (MPA) graduate\

  <p>This is a new series that we are trying to start on my channel/podcast, which\
  \ will be called \u201CRoundTable\u201D, and where we will be having conversations\
  \ with people involving the theoretical foundations of PsychTable, including people\
  \ that are working on different Evolved Psychological Adaptations (EPAs).</p>\n\
  <p>In this first episode, we talk about what PsychTable is about, and how it will\
  \ be built. We discuss the criteria used to classify something as an EPA; the kinds\
  \ of EPAs that would be considered (including cultural and group-level EPAs); who\
  \ would be able to access it, and how the evidence would be weighted; and who would\
  \ benefit from it, and in what ways. We also talk a bit about the relationship between\
  \ psychological adaptations and mental modules.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow their\
