shownotes: "Dr. Daniel Glass is a clinician and researcher in the disciplines of evolutionary\
  \ and clinical psychology. He has published sixteen peer-reviewed scholarly articles\
  \ in the fields of psychology, medicine, and evolutionary studies, on subjects ranging\
  \ from human emotions to peer bullying/victimization to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\
  \ He received his doctorate in clinical psychology from Suffolk University and is\
  \ currently a postdoctoral fellow at a private practice in Connecticut. His dissertation\
  \ is on the emotional processing function of dreaming.  \nMr. Niruban Balachandran\
  \ was a winner of the World Bank's Innovation Challenge Prize and the International\
  \ Society for Human Ethology's Linda Mealey Award. He is widely published in scholarly\
  \ journals and print media, and is a frequently-invited speaker at international\
  \ conferences. He is a Master of Public Administration (MPA) graduate of Harvard\
  \ University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, as well as a Bachelor of psychology\
  \ graduate from Rutgers. He was also a member of the Harvard Behavioral Insights\
  \ Group.  \nThey are both project co-leaders of PsychTable.\n\nThis is a new series\
  \ that we are trying to start on my channel/podcast, which will be called \u201C\
  RoundTable\u201D, and where we will be having conversations with people involving\
  \ the theoretical foundations of PsychTable, including people that are working on\
  \ different Evolved Psychological Adaptations (EPAs).\n\nIn this first episode,\
  \ we talk about what PsychTable is about, and how it will be built. We discuss the\
  \ criteria used to classify something as an EPA; the kinds of EPAs that would be\
  \ considered (including cultural and group-level EPAs); who would be able to access\
  \ it, and how the evidence would be weighted; and who would benefit from it, and\
  \ in what ways. We also talk a bit about the relationship between psychological\
  \ adaptations and mental modules.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:50  What is PsychTable? \
