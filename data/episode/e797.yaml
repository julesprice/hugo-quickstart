shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 27th 2023.  \nDr. Evelina Fedorenko is Middleton\
  \ CD Associate Professor of Neuroscience in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences department\
  \ at MIT. Her research focuses on the language system, including its internal architecture,\
  \ and its relationship with other cognitive systems. She uses behavioral, fMRI,\
  \ intracranial recording, computational, and genotyping methods in healthy adults\
  \ and individuals with brain disorders.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the language\
  \ system. We talk about the areas of the brain where language is processed; how\
  \ it is tied to other aspects of cognition; and if it is a biological adaptation.\
  \ We discuss the role that it plays in categorization. We talk about non-verbal\
  \ semantic processing. We discuss if there are cognitive differences between multilinguals\
  \ and monolinguals. We talk about cross-cultural research in neuroscience. We discuss\
  \ if there is a relationship between language and music. We talk about the use of\
  \ artificial neural networks and mapping models to study language. Finally, we discuss\
  \ if language processing is connected to general intelligence.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
