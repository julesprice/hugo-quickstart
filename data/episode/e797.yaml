shownotes: '<p>Dr. Evelina Fedorenko is Middleton CD Associate Professor of Neuroscience
  in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences department at MIT. Her research focuses on the
  language system, including its internal architecture, and its relationship with
  other cognitive systems.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about the language system. We talk about the areas of
  the brain where language is processed; how it is tied to other aspects of cognition;
  and if it is a biological adaptation. We discuss the role that it plays in categorization.
  We talk about non-verbal semantic processing. We discuss if there are cognitive
  differences between multilinguals and monolinguals. We talk about cross-cultural
  research in neuroscience. We discuss if there is a relationship between language
  and music. We talk about the use of artificial neural networks and mapping models
  to study language. Finally, we discuss if language processing is connected to general
  intelligence.</p>
