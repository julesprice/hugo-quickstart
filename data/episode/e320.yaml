shownotes: "<p>Max Beilby is a Management and Organizational Psychologist and author\
  \ of the Darwinian Business blog. He\u2019s currently working as a practitioner\
  \ in the banking industry.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about the application\
  \ of Evolutionary Psychology to Organizational Psychology. We start by tackling\
  \ the concept of evolutionary mismatch, and then go through some examples of it\
  \ that apply to the modern workplace, like Dunbar\u2019s number, leadership and\
  \ hierarchy, overconfidence, and dissatisfaction, stress, and burnout. We also refer\
  \ to sex differences and if they have any implications in the workplace. Finally,\
  \ we discuss possible solutions coming from the knowledge we already have and refer\
  \ to cultural evolution.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Max\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Darwinian\
