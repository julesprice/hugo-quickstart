shownotes: "Dr. Anthony Biglan is a Senior Scientist at Oregon Research Institute\
  \ and the Co-Director of the Promise Neighborhood Research Consortium. He has been\
  \ conducting research on the development and prevention of child and adolescent\
  \ problem behavior for the past several decades. His work has included studies of\
  \ the risk and protective factors associated with tobacco, alcohol, and other drug\
  \ use; high-risk sexual behavior; and antisocial behavior. He and colleagues at\
  \ the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences published a book summarizing\
  \ the epidemiology, cost, etiology, prevention, and treatment of youth with multiple\
  \ problems, called Helping Adolescents at Risk (2004). He is a former president\
  \ of the Society for Prevention Research. He was a member of the Institute of Medicine\
  \ Committee on Prevention. He\u2019s also the author of The Nurture Effect: How\
  \ the Science of Human Behavior Can Improve Our Lives and Our World.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on some of the main topics of Dr. Biglan\u2019s book, The Nurture\
  \ Effect. We refer to the role of evolution in the behavioral sciences, and to aspects\
  \ of the environment from families to schools and societies, and the negative effects\
  \ of coercive environments. We also discuss specifically addictive behaviors involving\
  \ tobacco, alcohol and drugs, risky sexual behavior, and anti-social behavior. In\
  \ the latter part of the interview, we also talk about cultural evolution, psychological\
  \ flexibility, and their relationship to the development of nurturing societies.\n\
