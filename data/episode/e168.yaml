shownotes: "<p>Dr. Anthony Biglan is a Senior Scientist at Oregon Research Institute\
  \ and the Co-Director of the Promise Neighborhood Research Consortium. He has been\
  \ conducting research on the development and prevention of child and adolescent\
  \ problem behavior for the past several decades. His work has included studies of\
  \ the risk and protective factors associated with tobacco, alcohol, and other drug\
  \ use; high-risk sexual behavior; and antisocial behavior. He and colleagues at\
  \ the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences published a book summarizing\
  \ the epidemiology, cost, etiology, prevention, and treatment of youth with multiple\
  \ problems, called Helping Adolescents at Risk (2004). He is a former president\
  \ of the Society for Prevention Research. He was a member of the Institute of Medicine\
  \ Committee on Prevention. He\u2019s also the author of The Nurture Effect: How\
  \ the Science of Human Behavior Can Improve Our Lives and Our World.</p>\n<p>In\
  \ this episode, we focus on some of the main topics of Dr. Biglan\u2019s book, The\
  \ Nurture Effect. We refer to the role of evolution in the behavioral sciences,\
  \ and to aspects of the environment from families to schools and societies, and\
  \ the negative effects of coercive environments. We also discuss specifically addictive\
  \ behaviors involving tobacco, alcohol and drugs, risky sexual behavior, and anti-social\
  \ behavior. In the latter part of the interview, we also talk about cultural evolution,\
  \ psychological flexibility, and their relationship to the development of nurturing\
  \ socities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Biglan\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty\
