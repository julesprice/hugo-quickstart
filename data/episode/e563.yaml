shownotes: "<p>Dr. Robert Brooks is Professor of Evolution at the University of New\
  \ South Wales in Sydney, Australia. He studies the evolution of mate choice, the\
  \ costs of being attractive, sexual conflict, the reason animals age and the links\
  \ between sex, diet, obesity and death. He is the author of Sex, Genes &amp; Rock\
  \ \u2018n\u2019 Roll: How Evolution has Shaped the Modern World, and, more recently,\
  \ Artificial Intimacy: Virtual Friends, Digital Lovers, and Algorithmic Matchmakers.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we focus on Artificial Intimacy. We talk about why a biologist\
  \ would focus on sex technology. We go through the biology of intimacy, and the\
  \ biology of love and romantic relationships, and how new technology exploits them.\
  \ We discuss the effects technology might have on mating strategies, and on gender\
  \ roles. We talk about the incel movement, and some equivalents in Japan, and how\
  \ in Japan people deal with romantic rejection differently. Finally, we talk about\
  \ how lowering the price of sex might be good, and how technology can help with\
  \ that.</p>\n"
