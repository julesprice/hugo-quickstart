shownotes: "<p>Dr. David Haig is an evolutionary biologist, geneticist, and professor\
  \ in Harvard University's Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. He\
  \ is interested in intragenomic conflict, genomic imprinting and parent\u2013offspring\
  \ conflict, and wrote the book Genomic Imprinting and Kinship. His major contribution\
  \ to the field of evolutionary theory is the kinship theory of genomic imprinting.\
  \ He\u2019s the author of several books, including the most recent one, From Darwin\
  \ to Derrida: Selfish Genes, Social Selves, and the Meanings of Life.</p>\n<p>In\
  \ this episode, we start off by talking about some basic concepts in evolutionary\
  \ biology, like what is a gene, units of selection, multi-level selection theory\
  \ and group selection. We then get into intragenomic conflict, parental antagonism,\
  \ and parent-offspring conflict. We talk about epigenetics, and development in the\
  \ context of natural selection from a gene-centered perspective. Finally, we get\
  \ into some of the topics from Dr. Haig\u2019s latest book, and discuss purpose\
  \ and meaning.</p>\n"
