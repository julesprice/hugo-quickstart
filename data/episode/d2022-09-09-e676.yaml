  <p>In this episode, we talk about the evolution of altruism. We start by talking
  about the most prominent evolutionary theories of human cooperation. We discuss
  how we can study intentional communities as a source of data about the evolution
  of cooperation. We get into altruistic punishment, kinship, fictive kinship, kin
  recognition, kin cues, and how they relate to the success of institutions. We discuss
  explanations for extreme altruism, like religious celibacy. Finally, we talk about
  the problem of cultural particularism in anthropology.</p>
