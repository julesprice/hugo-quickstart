shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 25th 2022.  \nDr. Lionel Page is a Professor of Economics\
  \ and Director of the Behavioural and Economic Science Cluster at the University\
  \ of Queensland. He is interested in understanding how people make decisions, alone\
  \ or in groups. His research links insights from economic theory (theory of decision\
  \ and game theory) and from other behavioral sciences such as psychology. He is\
  \ the author of Optimally Irrational: The Good Reasons We Behave the Way We Do.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on Optimally Irrational. We start by discussing what\
  \ it means to be optimally irrational, and how rationality has been traditionally\
  \ studied in economics. We talk about biases, replacing the H. economicus model,\
  \ and adding an evolutionary lens to human behavior. We then go through some psychological\
  \ phenomena, including rules of thumb and gut feelings; reference-dependence and\
  \ loss aversion; overweighting the probabilities of extreme outcomes; preferences;\
  \ kindness and reciprocity; emotions; commitment; social identity; indirect speech,\
  \ ambiguity and innuendos; and overconfidence and self-deception. Finally, we discuss\
  \ what rationality is.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:37  The premise of the\
