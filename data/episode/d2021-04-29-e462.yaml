shownotes: "<p>Dr. David Papineau is Professor of Philosophy at King's College London,\
  \ having previously taught for several years at Cambridge University where he was\
  \ a fellow of Robinson College. His new book is The Metaphysics of Sensory Experience.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we focus on The Metaphysics of Sensory Experience. We first\
  \ define sensory experience, discuss its conscious nature, and talk about false\
  \ sensory experiences, like illusions and hallucinations. We ask if sensory experience\
  \ is primarily about objects of subjects, and we also define what an object of perception\
  \ is. We discuss the relationship between metaphysics and epistemology. We talk\
  \ about different theories in the metaphysics of sensory experience, including na\xEF\
  ve realism, representationalism, and sense-datum theories. We detail Dr. Papineau\u2019\
  s qualitative view of sensory experience, and ask if it has anything to say about\
  \ concepts and consciousness. We talk about the distinction between sensory experience\
  \ and thought. Finally, we discuss if answering questions in the metaphysics of\
  \ sensory experience has any implications for metaphysics more generally.</p>\n"
