shownotes: "<p>Dr. Adam Rutherford is Lecturer in Biology and Society at University\
  \ College London\u2019s Department of Genes, Evolution, and Environment, and President\
  \ of Humanists UK. His interests are in evolution, genetics and developmental biology,\
  \ and the history of biology. He is the author of Control: The Dark History and\
  \ Troubling Present of Eugenics.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Control. We\
  \ start by discussing what eugenics is, and how old it is as an ideology. We discuss\
  \ if it makes sense to talk about \u201Cgood\u201D and \u201Cbad\u201D traits in\
  \ evolutionary biology, and the importance of genetic diversity. We talk about medical\
  \ interventions. We get into eugenics in the early 20th century, and how widespread\
  \ it was in the West. We talk about how some geneticists contributed to eugenics.\
  \ We discuss the concept of \u201Crace\u201D. We talk about behavior genetics, and\
  \ group differences. We also get into eugenics in contemporary academia and politics,\
  \ and talk about the \u201Cgreat replacement theory\u201D conspiracy theory. Finally,\
  \ we discuss if we should be worried about genetic engineering.</p>\n"
