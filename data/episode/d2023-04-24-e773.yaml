shownotes: "<p>Dr. Catarina Dutilh Novaes is Professor and University Research Chair\
  \ at the Department of Philosophy of the VU Amsterdam. She is also a Professorial\
  \ Fellow at Arch\xE9 in St. Andrews (2019-2024). She is currently running the ERC\
  \ Consolidator project &#39;The Social Epistemology of Argumentation&#39; (2018-2023).\
  \ Her main fields of research are history and philosophy of logic, philosophy of\
  \ mathematics, and social epistemology.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about argumentation,\
  \ reason, and disinformation. We start with argumentation, and discuss what is it\
  \ and what it is for; the contexts it applies to; what is a valid argument; adversariality;\
  \ the role of trust; argumentation as a social phenomenon, and disagreements with\
  \ Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber; the social epistemology of argumentation; and we\
  \ also discuss if argumentation changes minds. We then talk about reason, and a\
  \ disagreement with Mercier\u2019s and Sperber\u2019s modular nature of reason.\
  \ Finally, we discuss disinformation, and if it is a new phenomenon.</p>\n"
