shownotes: "<p>RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 4th, 2019.</p>\n<p>Dr. Douglas P. Fry is Professor\
  \ and Chair in the Department of Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of\
  \ North Carolina at Greensboro. He has written extensively on aggression, conflict,\
  \ and conflict resolution in his own books and in journals such as Science and American\
  \ Anthropologist. His work frequently engages the debate surrounding the origins\
  \ of war, arguing against claims that war or lethal aggression is rooted in human\
  \ evolution. He\u2019s the author or editor of books like The Human Potential for\
  \ Peace; Beyond War; War, Peace, and Human Nature; and Nurturing Our Humanity.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we focus on the anthropology of war. Dr. Fry critiques the evolutionary\
  \ psychology approach to war. We go through some of the flaws with the archaeological\
  \ evidence presented by Steven Pinker in The Batter Angels of Our Nature. We then\
  \ get into the ecological and social conditions that favor war, and critiques about\
  \ the data Napoleon Chagnon collected on the Yanomam\xF6. We also talk about violence-defusing\
  \ mechanisms in mammals. We end the interview talking about ways of preventing war\
  \ in modern societies.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Fry\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>(Upcoming\
