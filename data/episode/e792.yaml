shownotes: '<p>Dr. Justin Mogilski is Assistant Professor at the University of South
  Carolina Salkehatchie. His current program of research examines: 1) conflict resolution
  within consensually non-monogamous (CNM) romantic relationships, 2) how evolution
  has shaped moral decision-making, and 3) individual differences in predatory intimate
  relationship behaviors.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about romantic relationships. We talk about relationship
  satisfaction and what predicts it; emotional and sexual accessibility; what consensually
  non-monogamous relationships are and their different types; jealousy; where conflict
  arises from in monogamous and non-monogamous relationships; how people deal with
  jealousy in monogamous vs. non-monogamous relationships; conflict resolution in
  different kinds of relationships; sex differences in reconciliation behavior after
  romantic conflict; and the relationship between life history and multi-partner mating.
  Finally, we discuss why consensual non-monogamy is morally condemned.</p>
