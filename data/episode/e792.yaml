shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 21st 2022.  \nDr. Justin Mogilski is Assistant Professor\
  \ at the University of South Carolina Salkehatchie. His current program of research\
  \ examines: 1) conflict resolution within consensually non-monogamous (CNM) romantic\
  \ relationships (e.g., polyamory, open relationships, swinging), 2) how evolution\
  \ has shaped moral decision-making, and 3) individual differences in predatory intimate\
  \ relationship behaviors. He currently leads an international team of sexuality\
  \ and relationship researchers studying CNM relationship maintenance strategies.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about romantic relationships. We talk about relationship\
  \ satisfaction and what predicts it; emotional and sexual accessibility; what consensually\
  \ non-monogamous relationships are and their different types; jealousy; where conflict\
  \ arises from in monogamous and non-monogamous relationships; how people deal with\
  \ jealousy in monogamous vs. non-monogamous relationships; conflict resolution in\
  \ different kinds of relationships; sex differences in reconciliation behavior after\
  \ romantic conflict; and the relationship between life history and multi-partner\
  \ mating. Finally, we discuss why consensual non-monogamy is morally condemned.\n\
