  <p>In this episode, we talk about the psychological effects of media, and How Madness\
  \ Shaped History. We start by talking about a bit of the history of how people tend\
  \ to demonize new technology. We then get into specific technologies, like videogames,\
  \ movies, and series. We address specifically 13 Reasons Why, and screen time. Finally,\
  \ we cover come of the main topics of How Madness Shaped History, and discuss things\
  \ like a distinction between madness, mental illness, and insanity; how complicated\
  \ it is to diagnose historical figures; if mental health professionals should diagnose\
  \ politicians; and how someone gets mad.</p>\n"
