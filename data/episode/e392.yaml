shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 17th 2020.  \nDr. Christopher J. Ferguson is professor\
  \ of psychology at Stetson University. He is interested in media violence and, in\
  \ particular, video games. He has been invited to speak at Vice President Biden's\
  \ task force and a 2013 Institute of Medicine/CDC panel on the subject and in summer\
  \ 2018 testified at the School Safety Commission. His research has generally indicated\
  \ that exposure to media violence has little effect on societal violence. Dr. Ferguson\
  \ has emphasized the idea that media effects must be studied independently rather\
  \ than taking a \"one size fits all\" approach.  Thus, advertising may get us to\
  \ switch from one product to another even if video games don't turn kids into mass\
  \ killers.  Dr. Ferguson is also interested in the sociology of media research itself...how\
  \ political pressure, social moral panics and culture war can distort media effects\
  \ research into \"opinions with numbers.\". He\u2019s the author of How Madness\
  \ Shaped History: An Eccentric Array of Maniacal Rulers, Raving Narcissists, and\
  \ Psychotic Visionaries.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the psychological effects\
  \ of media, and How Madness Shaped History. We start by talking about a bit of the\
  \ history of how people tend to demonize new technology. We then get into specific\
  \ technologies, like videogames, movies, and series. We address specifically 13\
  \ Reasons Why, and screen time. Finally, we cover come of the main topics of How\
  \ Madness Shaped History, and discuss things like a distinction between madness,\
  \ mental illness, and insanity; how complicated it is to diagnose historical figures;\
  \ if mental health professionals should diagnose politicians; and how someone gets\
  \ mad.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:57  Demonizing new technology  \n05:22  Violent videogames\
