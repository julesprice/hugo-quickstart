  <p>In this episode, we focus on The Evolutionary Limits of Liberalism. We start
  with the premise of the book, and discuss what liberalism is; the opposing force
  of communitarianism; and individual preferences. We talk about free markets and
  liberal democracies in their capacity to satisfy preferences. We discuss the multilevel
  selection framework adopted in the book, and morality from an evolutionary perspective.
  We talk about moral types, and if it makes sense to distinguish between liberals
  and conservatives. We then discuss what really limits liberalism evolutionarily,
  individualism versus collectivism, and if liberal values will go extinct. Finally,
  we talk about the is/ought distinction.</p>
