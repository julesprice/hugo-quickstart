shownotes: "<p>Dr. Alberto Acerbi is a Lecturer in Psychology in the Centre for Culture\
  \ and Evolution at Brunel University London. He is a cognitive/evolutionary anthropologist\
  \ with a particular interest in computational science. The main question that drives\
  \ his research is: is it possible to find some general factors determining why some\
  \ cultural traits succeed and others do not? He is interested in particular in contemporary\
  \ cultural phenomena, and he uses a naturalistic, quantitative, and evolutionary\
  \ approach with different methodologies, especially individual-based models and\
  \ quantitative analysis of large-scale data. He published a book recently, Cultural\
  \ Evolution in the Digital Age.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Dr. Acerbi\u2019\
  s book, and go through some of its main topics, like the impact of new technologies\
  \ on cultural evolution; the similarities and differences between online activity\
  \ and real life; the impact of celebrities and online influencers; echo chambers\
  \ and political polarization; post-truth; and the opacity of online algorithms.\
  \ Toward the end, we also discuss theories in cultural evolution.</p>\n"
