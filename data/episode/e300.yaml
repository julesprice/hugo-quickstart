shownotes: "<p>Dr. Kristen Hawkes is Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the\
  \ University of Utah. Dr. Hawkes, an expert in human evolution and sociobiology,\
  \ is the author of several studies on the \u201Cgrandmother hypothesis,\u201D which\
  \ asserts that many of the characteristics that distinguish us from our ape ancestors\
  \ are thanks to the thoughtful care of our grandmothers. Her research is based on\
  \ ethnographic observation studies of hunter-gatherer communities such as the Ach\xE9\
  \ and Hadza. She has also developed mathematical models to model evolution over\
  \ time and trace the influence of grandmothers on human lifespan. Combining mathematical\
  \ modelling and observational studies she also researches the effects of fire on\
  \ ancient hunter-gatherers.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on the grandmother\
  \ hypothesis. First, Dr. Hawkes tells us about how she got to study the Ach\xE9\
  \ in Eastern Paraguay, and the Hadza in Tanzania, and the insights she got from\
  \ them. We go on a bit of a tangent to talk about human foraging behavior, and why\
  \ men hunt. Then, we discuss the grandmother hypothesis in its several dimensions,\
  \ referring to how grandmothers during our evolutionary history contributed to the\
  \ success of their grandchildren, and also increased their daughters\u2019 fertility,\
  \ for example. We also address the relationship between grandmothers and the evolution\
  \ of human life history. Finally, we talk about the evolution of menopause, the\
  \ role of grandfathers, and grandmothers in modern societies.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow\
