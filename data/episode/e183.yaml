shownotes: "<p>Dr. Charles H. Lineweaver is the convener of the Australian National\
  \ University's Planetary Science Institute and holds a joint appointment as an associate\
  \ professor in the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Research\
  \ School of Earth Sciences. He was a member of the COBE satellite team that discovered\
  \ the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background. Before his appointment\
  \ at ANU, he held post-doctoral positions at Strasbourg Observatory and the University\
  \ of New South Wales where he taught one of the most popular general studies courses\
  \ \"Are We Alone?\". His research areas include cosmology, exoplanetology, and astrobiology\
  \ and evolutionary biology.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about astrobiology.\
  \ We go through some general topics, like complexity in the Universe; Darwinian\
  \ and Lamarckian evolution; multilevel selection; looking for life on other planets,\
  \ the extremophile life forms, and if we could find life that is not carbon-based,\
  \ and related issues. In the end, we also discuss the scientific relevance of discovering\
  \ life elsewhere, and also the new perspective it would bring to humanity.</p>\n\
