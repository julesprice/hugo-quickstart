  \ BITS OF AUDIO HERE AND THERE, BUT THE CONNECTION WAS A BIT WEAK.  \nDr. Tyler\
  \ Volk is Professor of Biology and Environmental Studies at New York University.\
  \ His areas of interest include principles of form and function in systems (described\
  \ as metapatterns), environmental challenges to global prosperity, CO2 and global\
  \ change, biosphere theory and the role of life in earth dynamics. Dr. Volk has\
  \ authored seven books, most recently, Quarks to Culture: How We Came to Be. His\
  \ previous books include: CO2 Rising: The World\u2019s Greatest Environmental Challenge,\
  \ What is Death?: A Scientist Looks at the Cycle of Life, Gaia's Body: Toward a\
  \ Physiology of Earth, and Metapatterns: Across Space, Time, and Mind.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on Dr. Volk\u2019s book, Quarks to Culture. We talk about the\
  \ fundamental levels, from fundamental quanta to geopolitical states, and the three\
  \ dynamical realms of physical laws, biological evolution, and cultural evolution.\
  \ We also refer to the concepts of combogenesis and the alphakit, to understand\
  \ how we move from one level to the next. Toward the end, we also discuss how we\
  \ might be able to move beyond the level of geopolitical states.\n\nTime Links:\
