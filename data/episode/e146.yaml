shownotes: "Dr. Peggy Mason is a Professor in the Department of Neurobiology at the\
  \ University of Chicago. She received both her BA in Biology and her Phd in Neuroscience\
  \ from Harvard. Professor Mason has been on the faculty of University of Chicago\
  \ since 1992. She has taught undergraduate, graduate and medical students and has\
  \ received numerous teaching awards. Using her nearly 15 years of experience teaching\
  \ medical students, Professor Mason wrote a single-author textbook designed for\
  \ medical students (Medical Neurobiology, Oxford University Press, 2017). Professor\
  \ Mason's research focuses on the neurobiological basis of empathy and helping.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about empathy and helping behavior in humans and other\
  \ animal models, namely rats. We discuss first how empathy might have evolved, and\
  \ the neurobiological bases of it, including the roles played by the amygdala, the\
  \ hypothalamus, the prefrontal cortex and the temporo-parietal junction. We also\
  \ talk about the flaws with the research surrounding mirror neurons. Then, we talk\
  \ about the situations that invoke empathy. We also refer to Paul Bloom\u2019s book,\
  \ Against Empathy, and the difference between emotional empathy and cognitive empathy,\
  \ and between empathy and compassion. We also briefly refer to how empathy might\
  \ work in psychopaths. Finally, we talk about oxytocin and other hormones and neurotransmitters\
  \ that participate in mediating empathic behavior, and the differences between pro-social\
  \ behavior in humans and other animals. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:52  How empathy evolved\
