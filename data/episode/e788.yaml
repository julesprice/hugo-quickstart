shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 6th 2023.  \nDr. Alexander Bor is a postdoc at the\
  \ CEU Democracy Institute's Research Group on De- and Re-Democratization and a Visiting\
  \ Professor at CEU Vienna. He received an MA in Political Science at the CEU in\
  \ 2012, and a PhD in Political Science at Aarhus University in 2018, where he also\
  \ worked as a postdoc until 2022. His research focuses on how the human mind navigates\
  \ social and political challenges like political polarization, online political\
  \ hostility, the COVID-19 pandemic, or selecting and evaluating political leaders.\
  \ His work integrates insights from political behavior, social and evolutionary\
  \ psychology, and public health.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about online political\
  \ hostility, and the COVID-19 pandemic. We start by talking about the sharing of\
  \ fake news on social media, partisan polarization, and the psychology of online\
  \ political hostility. We then get into the COVID-19 pandemic, and go through topics\
  \ like motivating the public with health advice; compliance with fear; communicating\
  \ hope; individual factors that predicted acceptance of the vaccines; how governments\
  \ should have communicated about the vaccines; how the pandemic got moralized; prejudice\
  \ against the unvaccinated; and broader social and political effects on institutions\
  \ and social solidarity.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n01:42  The sharing of\
