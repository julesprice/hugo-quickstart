shownotes: "Dr. Richard Wrangham is Ruth B. Moore Professor of Biological Anthropology\
  \ in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University and founded\
  \ the Kibale Chimpanzee Project in 1987. He has conducted extensive research on\
  \ primate ecology, nutrition, and social behavior. He is best known for his work\
  \ on the evolution of human warfare, described in the book Demonic Males, and on\
  \ the role of cooking in human evolution, described in the book Catching Fire: How\
  \ Cooking Made Us Human. Together with Elizabeth Ross, he co-founded the Kasiisi\
  \ Project in 1997, and serves as a patron of the Great Apes Survival Partnership\
  \ (GRASP). He has also recently published the book The Goodness Paradox: The Strange\
  \ Relationship Between Virtue and Violence in Human Evolution (2019).\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on the main topics of Dr. Wrangham\u2019s latest book, The Goodness\
  \ Paradox. We talk about the differences between reactive aggression and proactive\
  \ aggression, comparing ourselves to other primates, and also evidence that comes\
  \ from studies with hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists and other traditional human\
  \ societies. Then, we discuss self-domestication, starting with the changes that\
  \ usually occur both at the physical and the behavioral levels in domesticated species,\
  \ and also some aspects of our sociality that might have favored self-domestication\
  \ in our species, with focus on the role that capital punishment has played. Finally,\
  \ we talk about group selection at the genetic and cultural levels, and also speculate\
  \ a bit on the possibility of some gene-culture coevolution processes that were\
  \ set in place after the advent of agriculture having contributed for the further\
  \ reduction of reactive aggression in humans.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:15  What is the\
