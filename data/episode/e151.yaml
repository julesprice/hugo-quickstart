shownotes: "<p>Dr. Richard Wrangham is Ruth B. Moore Professor of Biological Anthropology\
  \ in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University and founded\
  \ the Kibale Chimpanzee Project in 1987. He has conducted extensive research on\
  \ primate ecology, nutrition, and social behavior. He is best known for his work\
  \ on the evolution of human warfare, described in the book Demonic Males, and on\
  \ the role of cooking in human evolution, described in the book Catching Fire: How\
  \ Cooking Made Us Human. Together with Elizabeth Ross, he co-founded the Kasiisi\
  \ Project in 1997, and serves as a patron of the Great Apes Survival Partnership\
  \ (GRASP). He has also recently published the book The Goodness Paradox: The Strange\
  \ Relationship Between Virtue and Violence in Human Evolution (2019).</p>\n<p>In\
  \ this episode, we focus on the main topics of Dr. Wrangham\u2019s latest book,\
  \ The Goodness Paradox. We talk about the differences between reactive aggression\
  \ and proactive aggression, comparing ourselves to other primates, and also evidence\
  \ that comes from studies with hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists and other traditional\
  \ human societies. Then, we discuss self-domestication, starting with the changes\
  \ that usually occur both at the physical and the behavioral levels in domesticated\
  \ species, and also some aspects of our sociality that might have favored self-domestication\
  \ in our species, with focus on the role that capital punishment has played. Finally,\
  \ we talk about group selection at the genetic and cultural levels, and also speculate\
  \ a bit on the possibility of some gene-culture coevolution processes that were\
  \ set in place after the advent of agriculture having contributed for the further\
  \ reduction of reactive aggression in humans.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr.\
