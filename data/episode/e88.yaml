  \ at Austin. He\u2019s one of the founders of the field of evolutionary psychology.\
  \ His primary research focus is on strategies of human mating. He\u2019s the author\

  \ Psychology, Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we start off by talking a bit about Dr. Buss\u2019 background, and what\
  \ led him to Evolutionary Psychology. Then, we get into his research on human mating,\
  \ from the conceptual foundations to universal sex differences in mate preferences,\
  \ and mate retention tactics. We also discuss how modern technology might be tweaking\
  \ our brains into preferring short-term mating strategies, namely with things like\
  \ dating websites and online pornography. And we finish with some current work he\u2019\
  s doing on sexual morality, and if all of this knowledge can help couples with their\
  \ intimate relationships.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:51 How Dr. Buss got into\
