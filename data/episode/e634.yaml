shownotes: '<p>Dr. Simon Garnier is an Associate Professor of Biology at the New Jersey
  Institute of Technology. He is the head of the Swarm Lab, an interdisciplinary research
  lab that studies the mechanisms underlying Collective Behaviors and Swarm Intelligence
  in natural and artificial systems (http://www.theswarmlab.com). His research aims
  to reveal the detailed functioning of collective intelligence in systems as diverse
  as ant colonies, human crowds or robotic swarms.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about swarm intelligence. Topics include: examples of
  swarm intelligence in biological systems; collective decision-making; aggregation
  behavior; information; decision-making without brains or nervous systems, and embodied
  cognition; human crowds and collective intelligence; and phenomena that we could
  get a better grasp of through swarm intelligence, like human crowd motion, politics,
  and culture.</p>
