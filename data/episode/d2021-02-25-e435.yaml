  \ science of religion, and WEIRD psychology. We start by defining religion, and\
  \ talk a bit about its evolutionary and cultural foundations. We discuss how religion\
  \ is practiced, and distinguish between orthopraxic and orthodoxic religions. We\
  \ mention modes theory, and the best ways of studying religious rituals. We focus\
  \ specifically on high-arousal rituals. We discuss minimally counterintuitive ideas.\
  \ We talk about how relational mobility can explain certain aspects of religion.\
  \ We address how people practice religion in Japan, and its supposed atheistic nature.\
  \ Finally, we discuss WEIRD psychology, and the problem with distinguishing between\
  \ individualist and collectivist societies.</p>\n"
