shownotes: "<p>In this episode, we talk about the philosophy of the Black Mirror series,\

  \ and their interplay; the role that technology plays, and if it leaves space open\
  \ for human agency; personhood, the self, copies, simulations, and how we should\
  \ deal with them; what it is to be the \u201Ctrue\u201D person; the benefits of\
  \ virtual reality, as well as its drawbacks; mortality, immortality, and the meaning\
  \ of life; punishment and Nietzsche\u2019s Eternal Return; how we should deal with\
  \ memory and knowledge, and what we should know. In the latter part of the discussion,\
