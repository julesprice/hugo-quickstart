shownotes: "<p>Dr. Benjamin Bergen is Professor of Cognitive Science at the University\
  \ of California San Diego. His research interests include language comprehension\
  \ and production, including grammar, word meaning, metaphor, profanity, and talking\
  \ while driving. He\u2019s the author of the books Louder Than Words: The New Science\
  \ of How the Mind Makes Meaning, and What the F: What Swearing Reveals About Our\
  \ Language, Our Brains, and Ourselves.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on embodied\
  \ cognition and language. First, we tackle what embodied cognition is about. Then,\
  \ we get into language (and meaning). We refer to the embodied simulation hypothesis,\
  \ and to experiments to know the mental simulations people are performing. We also\
  \ discuss the drawbacks of mentalese (language of thought). We ask if language influences\
  \ thought, and how. We talk about different cognitive styles \u2013 verbalizers,\
  \ and visualizers \u2013 and ask how can we even understand each other. In the final\
  \ parts of the interview, we talk about how we get from simulations of physical\
  \ aspects of existence to abstract concepts; what is embodied simulation really\
  \ good for; and if we can improve AI systems with knowledge from embodied cognition\
  \ and simulation.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Bergen\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty\
