shownotes: "Dr. Nancy Segal is Professor of Developmental Psychology and Director\
  \ of the Twin Studies Center, at California State University, Fullerton. She\u2019\
  s been the recipient of many awards and distinctions. She served as Assistant Director\
  \ of the Minnesota Center for Twin and Adoption Research, in the Department of Psychology\
  \ at the University of Minnesota, from 1985 to 1991. She\u2019s also the author\
  \ of many books, including Entwined Lives, Indivisible by Two, Someone Else's Twin,\
  \ Born Together-Reared Apart, and, the latest one, Accidental Brothers: The Story\
  \ of Twins Exchanged at Birth and the Power of Nature and Nurture.\n\nThe central\
  \ theme of this episode is Dr. Segal\u2019s latest book, Accidental Brothers. We\
  \ start the conversation with some personal questions, about what it was for Dr.\
  \ Segal to live as and have a relationship with her fraternal twin, and also what\
  \ she deemed to be the most interesting findings coming from the MISTRA (Minnesota\
  \ Study of Twins Reared Apart). Subsequent topics include: studies with identical,\
  \ fraternal and virtual twins, and triplets, and what they teach us about human\
  \ nature; how people express themselves more fully as they get independent from\
  \ their family; the nature vs nurture dichotomy, and also nurture via nature and\
  \ nature via nurture approaches; the role of chance in people\u2019s lives; epigenetics\
  \ and the prenatal environment; how behavioral genetics might inform parenting practices;\
  \ and related subjects.  \n \nTime Links:  \n01:08  Growing up as a fraternal twin\
