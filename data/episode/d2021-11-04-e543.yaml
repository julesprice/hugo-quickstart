shownotes: '<p>Dr. Orestis Palermos is Lecturer in the School of English, Communication
  and Philosophy at Cardiff University. He works at the intersection of philosophy
  of mind and cognitive science, epistemology, philosophy of science and philosophy
  of technology. He is interested in the idea of philosophical engineering: the way
  philosophy can impact the design of emerging technologies and socio-technical systems.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about epistemology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy
  of technology. We distinguish between internalism and externalism in epistemology,
  and then talk about extended and distributed cognition. We talk about social epistemology,
  and different kinds of technologies that allow for extended cognition. We ask if
  students should be allowed to use Google in their exams. We discuss how we should
  think about culture in terms of epistemology. We discuss how science works. Finally,
  we talk about philosophical engineering.</p>
