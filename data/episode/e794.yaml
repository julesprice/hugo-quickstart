shownotes: "Dr. Oriel FeldmanHall is the Alfred Manning Associate Professor of Cognitive,\
  \ Linguistic and Psychological Sciences at Brown University. She has been the recipient\
  \ of several awards, including the Association for Psychological Science Rising\
  \ Star Award, the NARSAD Young Investigator Award from the Brain & Behavior Research\
  \ Foundation, the Herry Merritt Wriston Award for excellence in teaching and scholarship,\
  \ and the Social and Affective Neuroscience Society's Innovation Award. Dr. FeldmanHall's\
  \ research seeks to disentangle the cognitive and neural processes behind the complex\
  \ choices that form the basis of human social behavior.\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about morality from the perspective of social neuroscience. We discuss if it makes\
  \ sense to talk about different psychological ingredients to morality, like moral\
  \ foundations. We talk about the role of emotion in decision-making, and the regions\
  \ of the brain that participate in moral decision-making. We discuss what drives\
  \ us to help others, and if the question of whether we are selfish of selfless makes\
  \ sense. We talk about how learning shapes our moral values; how social norms evolve,\
  \ and why we comply to them; and how people weigh competing moral motivations. We\
  \ talk about uncertainty in social contexts, and how people reduce it. We discuss\
  \ the disconnect between people\u2019s moral beliefs and their behavior. Finally,\
  \ we address general questions, like the nature vs. nurture debate; how social neuroscience\
  \ relates to the social sciences and neuroscience; and if there are objective moral\
  \ values.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:54  Morality from the perspective\
