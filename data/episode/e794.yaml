shownotes: "<p>Dr. Oriel FeldmanHall is the Alfred Manning Associate Professor of\
  \ Cognitive, Linguistic and Psychological Sciences at Brown University. Dr. FeldmanHall&#39;s\
  \ research seeks to disentangle the cognitive and neural processes behind the complex\
  \ choices that form the basis of human social behavior.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we talk about morality from the perspective of social neuroscience. We discuss\
  \ if it makes sense to talk about different psychological ingredients to morality,\
  \ like moral foundations. We talk about the role of emotion in decision-making,\
  \ and the regions of the brain that participate in moral decision-making. We discuss\
  \ what drives us to help others. We talk about how learning shapes our moral values;\
  \ how social norms evolve, and why we comply to them; and how people weigh competing\
  \ moral motivations. We talk about uncertainty in social contexts, and how people\
  \ reduce it. We discuss the disconnect between people\u2019s moral beliefs and their\
  \ behavior. Finally, we address general questions, like the nature vs. nurture debate;\
  \ how social neuroscience relates to the social sciences and neuroscience; and if\
  \ there are objective moral values.</p>\n"
