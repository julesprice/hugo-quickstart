  \ wellbeing, also known as positive anthropology, as developed by Dr. Fischer. Before\
  \ tackling the topic, we talk about the different branches of anthropology in the\
  \ US. We then get into questions regarding the good life, values, stated and revealed\
  \ preferences, and meta-preferences. We also mention how the market allows for the\
  \ expression of values. Finally, we talk about Dr. Fischer\u2019s work on the Maya\
  \ culture in Guatemala, their values, and in what ways they connect with coffee\
  \ production.</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Fischer\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty page: <a href=\"\
