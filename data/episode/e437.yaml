shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 14th 2020.  \nDr. Allan Horwitz is Board of Governors\
  \ Professor in the Department of Sociology and Institute for Health, Health Care\
  \ Policy, and Aging Research at Rutgers University. He has also chaired the Mental\
  \ Health and Medical Sociology Sections of the American Sociological Association,\
  \ as well as the Psychiatric Sociology Section of the Society for the Study of Social\
  \ Problems. His research has focused on the sociology of mental health and illness.\
  \ In 2006, he received the Leonard I. Pearlin Award for Distinguished Contributions\
  \ to the Sociological Study of Mental Health from the American Sociological Association's\
  \ Section on Sociology of Mental Health. In addition, he has published several books\
  \ including What\u2019s Normal? Reconciling Biology and Culture (Oxford University\
  \ Press, 2016).\n\nIn this episode, we focus on \u201CWhat\u2019s Nomal?\u201D.\
  \ We first discuss issues with the discipline of sociology, and the difference between\
  \ it and anthropology. We talk about the history of the contention between biology\
  \ and culture. We then run through several examples of social phenomena explored\
  \ in the book, like incest taboos, first names, cowardice and courage, grief, sexuality\
  \ and gender, and mental illness. We also ask what is normality, and discuss the\
  \ concept of evolutionary mismatch, and some examples it applies to, related to\
  \ human health and human psychology. Dr. Horwitz explains his Harmful Disfunction\
  \ approach to social phenomena. Toward the end, we talk abut how we can improve\
  \ scientific disciplines that are either centered on biology or culture.\n\nTime\
