  \ and Culture (Oxford University Press, 2016).</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus\
  \ on \u201CWhat\u2019s Nomal?\u201D. We first discuss issues with the discipline\
  \ of sociology, and the difference between it and anthropology. We talk about the\
  \ history of the contention between biology and culture. We then run through several\
  \ examples of social phenomena explored in the book, like incest taboos, first names,\
  \ cowardice and courage, grief, sexuality and gender, and mental illness. We also\
  \ ask what is normality, and discuss the concept of evolutionary mismatch, and some\
  \ examples it applies to, related to human health and human psychology. Dr. Horwitz\
  \ explains his Harmful Disfunction approach to social phenomena. Toward the end,\
  \ we talk about how we can improve scientific disciplines that are either centered\
  \ on biology or culture.</p>\n"
