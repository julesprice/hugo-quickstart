  \ about the current cultural and political context in the US and its historical\
  \ background. We discuss the George Floyd incident and its aftermath, and the Black\
  \ Lives Matter movement. We define the \u201Celites\u201D in the social justice\
  \ movement, and talk about the political consequences of the social justice movement\
  \ being taken over by them. We discuss affirmative action, and intersectionality.\
  \ We talk about the term \u201Cwoke\u201D. Finally, we discuss solutions to improve\
  \ leftist activism in the US.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:25  The current\
