shownotes: '<p>Dr. Dean Buonomano is Professor of Neurobiology and Psychology at the
  University of California, Los Angeles. His research goal is to understand how neurons
  develop selective responses to temporal features such as duration, interval and
  order. He is the author of Brain Bugs, and Your Brain is a Time Machine.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about the neuroscience of timing. We start by discussing
  how to understand time from the perspective of neuroscience, and how the brain processes
  time. We talk about factors that influence our perception of time, when it comes
  to duration, interval, and order. We discuss the relationship between neural time
  and subjective time, how the brain encodes neural time in patterns of neural activity,
  and if there are brain regions specialized in time processing. We talk about the
  interaction between timing and the sensory systems, and timing as an intrinsic property
  of neural networks. We discuss the relationship between neural time and the physical
  nature of time. Finally, we talk about what a mental clock is.</p>
