shownotes: '<p>This is the second part of our 2-part episode on the history of evolutionary
  theory/biology.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we start with population genetics, its early developments, how
  it led to the development of inclusive fitness theory, and what happened after the
  discovery of the double-helix structure of the DNA, what we learn about evolution
  by natural selection by understanding genetics, and how to detect adaptive evolution
  on the level of the genome. We then discuss speciation, what we know about it, and
  some of the controversies there. We address specifically the question of why there
  are more species more densely packed as one moves from the poles to the Equator.
  Finally, we talk about what we can learn by studying evolution in islands.</p>
