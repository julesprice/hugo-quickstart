shownotes: "<p>Dr. Kevin Mitchell is Associate Professor of Genetics and Neuroscience\
  \ at Trinity College Dublin. He\u2019s the author of Innate: How the Wiring of Our\
  \ Brains Shapes Who We Are.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about psychological\
  \ epigenetics. We first address what is epigenetics, and when people first identified\
  \ epigenetic mechanisms or theorized about them. We refer to several mechanisms,\
  \ involving chromatin, methylation, and others. We discuss if epigenetics fits into\
  \ the larger puzzle of evolutionary theory. We talk about the problems and limitations\
  \ of studies of transgenerational epigenetics done in mice and humans, and we refer\
  \ to the Dutch famine and Irish famine studies. We refer to how psychoanalysts deal\
  \ with epigenetics, and what it would take for a behavior to modify the epigenetic\
  \ profile of an individual and then get transmitted to their offspring. We mention\
  \ other fads in neuroscience, like neuroplasticity and mirror neurons. We discuss\
  \ modularity of mind. Finally, we talk about how the science of epigenetics should\
  \ be communicated to the general public. We end with a brief teaser to Dr. Mitchell\u2019\
  s next book.</p>\n"
