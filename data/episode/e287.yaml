  \ in the Law School at the National University of Ireland, Galway. He holds a BCL\
  \ from University College Cork (2006); an LLM from Trinity College Dublin (2007);\
  \ and a PhD from University College Cork (2011). He was lecturer in law at Keele\
  \ University in the UK from 2011 until 2014. He joined NUI Galway in July 2014.\
  \ Dr. Danaher\u2019s research focuses on the ethical, legal and social implications\
  \ of new technologies. He maintains a blog called Philosophical Disquisitions, and\
  \ produces a podcast with the same title. He also writes for the Institute for Ethics\
  \ and Emerging Technologies, and is the author of the recent book, Automation and\
  \ Utopia: Human Flourishing in a World without Work.\n\nIn this episode, we go through\
  \ the major topics in Dr. Danaher\u2019s book, Automation and Utopia. We first talk\
  \ about human obsolescence, the present conditions of the labor market, and how\
  \ to improve them through automation. We discuss technological unemployment and\
  \ the Universal Basic Income. Then, we talk about how automation might interfere\
  \ with domains of human life that could impede human flourishing. We also address\
  \ the advantages and disadvantages of turning into cyborgs. Finally, we discuss\
  \ what would be a virtual utopia, and game ethics.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:50  Human\
