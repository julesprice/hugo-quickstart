shownotes: "<p>Dr. Adina Roskies is The Helman Family Distinguished Professor and\
  \ Chair of the Cognitive Science Program at Dartmouth College. Dr. Roskies&#39;\
  \ philosophical research interests lie at the intersection of philosophy and neuroscience,\
  \ and include philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, and ethics. She was a member\
  \ of the McDonnell Project in Neurophilosophy, and the MacArthur Law and Neuroscience\
  \ Project.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about neuroimaging studies, neuroethics,\
  \ and free will. Starting with neuroimaging, we discuss the information we can get\
  \ from it; what brain activity means; and what neuroscience adds to the study of\
  \ human behavior. We then get into neuroethics, and talk about agency, going through\
  \ an example of deep brain stimulation applied to alleviating Parkinson\u2019s Disease;\
  \ criteria for medical interventions; neuroscience in the courtroom; and moral responsibility.\
  \ We also discuss issues with how scientists approach free will, including Robert\
  \ Sapolsky\u2019s approach; conditions where people lack free will; if free will\
  \ can exist without consciousness; and the idea of \u201Cfree won\u2019t\u201D.</p>\n"
