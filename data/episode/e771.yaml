shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 30th 2022.  \nDr. Jordi Cam\xED is Professor of Pharmacology\
  \ (specialist in Clinical Pharmacology) at Pompeu Fabra University, General Director\
  \ of the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park (PRBB), and Director of the Pasqual\
  \ Maragall Foundation.   \nDr. Luis Miguel Mart\xEDnez is Head of the Laboratory\
  \ of Visual Analogy at the Neuroscience Institute of Alicante.  \nThey are both\
  \ authors of The Illusionist Brain: The Neuroscience of Magic.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on The Illusionist Brain. We talk about magic from the perspective of\
  \ neuroscience, and explore aspects of human cognition like the visual system, memory,\
  \ attention, change blindness, decision-making, and the cultural context. We discuss\
  \ if people in industrialized societies are less susceptible to magic, how technology\
  \ influences the development of magic, and if magicians are scientists. Finally,\
  \ we talk about why magic is an ecologically valid way of studying human cognition.\n\
