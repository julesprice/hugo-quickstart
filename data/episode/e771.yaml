shownotes: "<p>Dr. Jordi Cam\xED is Professor of Pharmacology (specialist in Clinical\
  \ Pharmacology) at Pompeu Fabra University, General Director of the Barcelona Biomedical\
  \ Research Park (PRBB), and Director of the Pasqual Maragall Foundation.</p>\n<p>Dr.\
  \ Luis Miguel Mart\xEDnez is Head of the Laboratory of Visual Analogy at the Neuroscience\
  \ Institute of Alicante.</p>\n<p>They are both authors of The Illusionist Brain:\
  \ The Neuroscience of Magic.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on The Illusionist\
  \ Brain. We talk about magic from the perspective of neuroscience, and explore aspects\
  \ of human cognition like the visual system, memory, attention, change blindness,\
  \ decision-making, and the cultural context. We discuss if people in industrialized\
  \ societies are less susceptible to magic, how technology influences the development\
  \ of magic, and if magicians are scientists. Finally, we talk about why magic is\
  \ an ecologically valid way of studying human cognition.</p>\n"
