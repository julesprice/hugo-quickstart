shownotes: "<p>Dr. Drew Bailey is Associate Professor in the School of Education at\
  \ the University of California, Irvine. His research interests include mathematical\
  \ development, individual differences, and longitudinal methods.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we talk about individual differences in educational attainment, educational\
  \ interventions, and sex differences in cognitive abilities. We start by discussing\
  \ what to think about the finding in behavioral genetics when it comes to educational\
  \ attainment. We talk about educational interventions, what works and what does\
  \ not, and how their effects fade out. We discuss if education systems should be\
  \ reformed, and what are some of the biggest challenges there and how to deal with\
  \ them. Finally, we discuss sex differences in education, educational choices, and\
  \ educational attainment; we talk about the gender equality paradox and how it is\
  \ interpreted and explained; and sex differences in cognitive abilities \u2013 verbal,\
  \ spatial, and mathematical -, and how impactful they are in education.</p>\n"
