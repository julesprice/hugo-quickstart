shownotes: "RECORDED ON April 16th, 2020.  \nDr. Melanie Meng Xue is assistant professor\
  \ in the Social Science Division at New York University in Abu Dhabi. Her research\
  \ lies at the intersection of economic history and political economy. She has studied\
  \ the rise of gender-equitable beliefs and the deterioration of civil society in\
  \ the context of imperial China. By tracing the impact of historical events over\
  \ time and in various institutional settings, her work isolates the role of values,\
  \ beliefs and norms in shaping economic and political disparities. Another strand\
  \ of Dr. Meng Xue\u2019s research concerns the decoding of folklore and mythology\
  \ as a new approach to understanding historical values.\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about how to study values, beliefs, and norms, and how they change over time,\
  \ from a historical perspective. We go through the example of the history of China,\
  \ and the transition from imperial China to communist China and State capitalist\
  \ China, and we focus mostly on how gender beliefs changed over time.  \n\nTime\
