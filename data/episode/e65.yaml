shownotes: "<p>Dr. Dale Purves is Geller Professor of Neurobiology Emeritus at the\
  \ Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, at Duke University. He was elected to the National\
  \ Academy of Sciences in 1989 for his work on neural development and synaptic plasticity.\
  \ He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy\
  \ of Medicine. He is the author of many books, including Principles of Neural Development,\
  \ and Brains: How they Seem to Work, and also the lead author on the textbooks Neuroscience,\
  \ and Principles of Cognitive Neuroscience. His research during the last 15 years\
  \ has sought to explain why we see and hear what we do, focusing on the visual perception\
  \ of lightness, color, form, and motion, and the auditory perception of music and\
  \ speech.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk how perception evolved and works; how\
  \ our cognitive systems have an innate structural organization, but also allow for\
  \ neuroplasticity at the same time; what are illusions; if there\u2019s any direct\
  \ relation between conscious perception and the production of behavior, as when\
  \ we\u2019re driving and thinking about something, and not consciously aware of\
  \ our surroundings; understanding perception in wholly empirical terms; and the\
  \ proper way to look at the relationship between perception and reality as such.</p>\n\
