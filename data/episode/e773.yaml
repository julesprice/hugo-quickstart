  \ and University Research Chair at the Department of Philosophy of the VU Amsterdam.\
  \ She is also a Professorial Fellow at Arch\xE9 in St. Andrews (2019-2024). She\
  \ is currently running the ERC Consolidator project 'The Social Epistemology of\

  \ has general interests in medieval philosophy, philosophy of psychology and cognitive\
  \ science, general philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, issues pertaining\

  \nIn this episode, we talk about argumentation, reason, and disinformation. We start\
  \ with argumentation, and discuss what is it and what it is for; the contexts it\
  \ applies to; what is a valid argument; adversariality; the role of trust; argumentation\
  \ as a social phenomenon, and disagreements with Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber; the\
  \ social epistemology of argumentation; and we also discuss if argumentation changes\
  \ minds. We then talk about reason, and a disagreement with Mercier\u2019s and Sperber\u2019\
  s modular nature of reason. Finally, we discuss disinformation, and if it is a new\
  \ phenomenon.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n01:20  What is argumentation, and\
