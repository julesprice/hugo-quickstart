shownotes: "<p>Dr. Melinda Zeder is Curator Emeritus in the Department of Anthropology\
  \ of the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. Her zooarchaeological\
  \ research has revolutionized the understanding of animal domestication. She has\
  \ conducted extensive fieldwork throughout the Near East, including in Iran, Israel,\

  \ We discuss topics such as domestication; if domestication of agriculture came\
  \ first, and if the question even makes sense; the origins of agriculture, and the\
  \ several different sites throughout the globe where it developed independently;\
  \ the concept of niche construction, and how it applies to humans; and the Anthropocene.</p>\n\
