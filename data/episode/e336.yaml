shownotes: "RECORDED ON April 9th, 2020.  \nDr. Melinda Zeder is Curator Emeritus\
  \ in the Department of Anthropology of the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian\
  \ Institution. Her zooarchaeological research has revolutionized the understanding\
  \ of animal domestication. She has conducted extensive fieldwork throughout the\
  \ Near East, including in Iran, Israel, Turkey, and Syria. Her research focuses\
  \ on the origins of plant and animal domestication, and the impacts of agriculture\
  \ on human prehistory. She has also pioneered approaches that combine archaeological\
  \ and genetic analyses of plant and animal remains from archaeological sites.\n\n\
  In this episode, we talk about zooarachaeology. We discuss topics such as domestication;\
  \ if domestication of agriculture came first, and if the question even makes sense;\
  \ the origins of agriculture, and the several different sites throughout the globe\
  \ where it developed independently; the concept of niche construction, and how it\
  \ applies to humans; and the Anthropocene. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:00  What is zooarchaeology?\
