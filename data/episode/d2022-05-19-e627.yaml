shownotes: "<p>Dr. Tanya Marie Luhrmann is the Albert Ray Lang Professor in the Stanford\
  \ Anthropology Department. She is a medical and psychological anthropologist, and\
  \ also an anthropologist of religion. More recently she describes her work as an\
  \ anthropology of mind. Her books include How God Becomes Real: Kindling the Presence\
  \ of Invisible Others.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on How God Becomes Real.\
  \ We cover the main hypotheses put forth in the book: people don\u2019t easily have\
  \ faith in gods and spirits; detailed stories help to make gods and spirits feel\
  \ real; the way people think about their minds also matters; the sense of response\
  \ is \u201Ckindled\u201D; prayer practice changes the way people attend to their\
  \ thoughts; talent and training matter; and people create relationships with gods\
  \ and spirits. We also talk about the role of rituals and religious imagery, the\
  \ health benefits of religion, comparative phenomenology, an \u201Cattentional learning\u201D\
  \ theory of religion, and the New Atheists.</p>\n"
