shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 23rd 2022.  \nDr. Suki Finn is a Lecturer in Philosophy\
  \ at Royal Holloway University of London. Her research spans the areas of metametaphysics,\
  \ the metaphysics of pregnancy, the epistemology of logic, and feminist and queer\
  \ theory. She is the editor of 'Women of Ideas' published with Oxford University\
  \ Press which is a selection of interviews with women from Philosophy Bites. She\
  \ is an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy; she is on the Executive\
  \ Committee for the Society for Women in Philosophy UK; she is on the Council for\
  \ the Royal Institute of Philosophy; and she is a Union Committee member for RHUL\
  \ UCU.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the epistemology of logic, the philosophy\
  \ of love, and the metaphysics of pregnancy. We first discuss the epistemology of\
  \ logic, and the relationship between logic and rationality. We then get into the\
  \ philosophy of love, and talk about unconditional love, Bayesian probability theory,\
  \ and games like poker. Finally, we discuss the metaphysics of pregnancy, and go\
  \ through questions like if the fetus if a part of the mother, abortion, birth,\
  \ and pregnancy-related technologies.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:44  The\
