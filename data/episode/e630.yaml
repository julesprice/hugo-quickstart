  <p>In this episode, we talk about the epistemology of logic, the philosophy of love,
  and the metaphysics of pregnancy. We first discuss the epistemology of logic, and
  the relationship between logic and rationality. We then get into the philosophy
  of love, and talk about unconditional love, Bayesian probability theory, and games
  like poker. Finally, we discuss the metaphysics of pregnancy, and go through questions
  like if the fetus if a part of the mother, abortion, birth, and pregnancy-related
  technologies.</p>
