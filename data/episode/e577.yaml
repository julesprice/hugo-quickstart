  \ evolution, linguistics, animal cognition, and the philosophy of biology.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about linguistics, cultural evolution, and animal cognition.\
  \ We start with linguistics, and discuss if language is innate or acquired and Universal\
  \ Grammar; approaches to the study of the evolution of languages, like Bayesian\
  \ phylolinguistics; constraints in linguistic variation; the evolution of languages\
  \ in the Pacific and the timing of peopling there; and what we know about the Indo-European\
  \ language(s). We then talk about religion: how notions of god vary with ecology;\
  \ the relationship between Big Gods and social complexity; and ritual human sacrifice\
  \ and the evolution of stratified societies. We discuss D-PLACE, and the difficulties\
  \ in building comparative cultural databases. Finally, we discuss animal cognition,\
  \ with a focus on the cognition of New Caledonian crows and their tool use. We talk\
  \ about tool use in animals, the relationship between brain size and cognitive ability,\
  \ and the problems with talking about a generally \u201Csmart\u201D species and\
  \ \u201Cone cognition\u201D.</p>\n"
