shownotes: "<p>Dr. Cristine Legare is a professor of psychology and the director of\
  \ the Evolution, Variation, and Ontogeny of Learning Laboratory at The University\
  \ of Texas at Austin. Her research examines how the human mind enables us to learn,\
  \ create, and transmit culture. She conducts comparisons across age, culture, and\
  \ species to address fundamental questions about cognitive and cultural evolution.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we first talk about the phylogenetic and ontogenetic bases of\
  \ culture. We also refer to the cognitive bases of culture. We ask if isolated individuals\
  \ would ever develop culture. We discuss how children acquire culture; core knowledge,\
  \ and how it varies across societies; causal learning; imitation; and natural and\
  \ supernatural explanatory frameworks. We then address what renders it so difficult\
  \ for people to accept and understand evolution by natural selection.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
