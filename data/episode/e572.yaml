shownotes: "<p>Dr. G\xFCnter Wagner is Alison Richard Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary\
  \ Biology in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and Adjunct Professor\
  \ of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at Yale University, and Adjunct\
  \ Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Wayne State University. He is an evolutionary\
  \ geneticist with training in biochemical engineering, zoology and mathematics from\
  \ the University of Vienna, Austria. Dr. Wagner's research interest is the evolution\
  \ of gene regulation as it pertains to the origin of evolutionary novelties.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about gene regulation, evolutionary novelties, and pregnancy.\
  \ We start with gene evolution, why it evolved, its importance in evolution, pleiotropy\
  \ and polygeny, and the relationship between development and evolution. We then\
  \ get into evolutionary novelties, complex organisms, functional specialization,\
  \ and the concept of \u201Cevolvability\u201D. Finally, we talk about the evolution\
  \ of pregnancy, endometrial stromal cells, why the fetus is not attacked by the\
  \ mother\u2019s immune system, and the relationship between invasive placentation\
  \ and malignant cancer.</p>\n"
