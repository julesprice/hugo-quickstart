  \ episode, we focus on The New Science of Narcissism. First we define narcissism.\
  \ We talk about its heritability, and the relationship with the Big Five personality\
  \ traits, and with the Dark Triad. We discuss the benefits and costs of narcissism,\
  \ for the narcissist and for the people around him. We refer to Trump, and ask if\
  \ mental health professionals should diagnose political figures. We talk about social\
  \ media and its relationship with narcissism. We ask if it is possible to reduce\
  \ levels of narcissism in individuals, and also who should seek therapy. Toward\
  \ the end, we talk about the cultural aspects of mental disorders, and the questions\
  \ about narcissism we have yet to answer.</p>\n"
