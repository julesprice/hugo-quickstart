shownotes: "<p>Dr. Kim Hill is a professor in the Anthropology department at Arizona\
  \ State University.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about hunter-gatherer tribes\
  \ and human sociality. We walk through many of the societies Dr. Hill studied, including\
  \ the Ach\xE9, the Hiwi, the Mashco-Piro, the Matsiguenga, the Yora, and the Sea\
  \ Nomads, and aspects of their sociality. We get into like what anthropologists\
  \ learn by studying traditional societies, how we can compare contemporary hunter-gatherers\
  \ with the societies we evolved in, and human universals, and if societies have\
  \ more similarities or differences. We ask if it is better to live in traditional\
  \ or industrialized societies. We then go through several aspects of human sociality,\
  \ including foraging, food sharing, life history and parental investment, human\
  \ cooperation and cultural norms, fission-fusion phenomena, co-residence, marriage,\
  \ inter-band interactions and cumulative culture, and wealth and economic inequality.\
  \ Finally, we talk about why we should protect isolated tribes, and how to do it\
  \ best.</p>\n"
