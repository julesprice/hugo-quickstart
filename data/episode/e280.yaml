shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 29th, 2019.  \nDr. Manuel Vargas is a professor in\
  \ the Department of Philosophy at UC San Diego, where he teaches classes on various\
  \ topics, including ethics, the history of Mexican philosophy, and whatever it is\
  \ he\u2019s thinking about with respect to agency, moral psychology, and sociality.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on free will, moral responsibility, and the legal system.\
  \ We first discuss what free will is about, and how we can determine if it exists.\
  \ We also consider the degree to which we should take folk intuitions about free\
  \ will seriously. We talk about how we can move from knowledge about people\u2019\
  s blameworthiness to deciding how to punish them. We then discuss social justice,\
  \ and how much weight we should attribute to the environmental conditions people\
  \ live in, when judging them. Finally, we talk about the concept of history, and\
  \ its importance for moral responsibility, and the role of moral luck.\n\nTime Links:\
