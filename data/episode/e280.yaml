shownotes: "<p>Dr. Manuel Vargas is a professor in the Department of Philosophy at\
  \ UC San Diego, where he teaches classes on various topics, including ethics, the\
  \ history of Mexican philosophy, and whatever it is he\u2019s thinking about with\
  \ respect to agency, moral psychology, and sociality.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we\
  \ focus on free will, moral responsibility, and the legal system. We first discuss\
  \ what free will is about, and how we can determine if it exists. We also consider\
  \ the degree to which we should take folk intuitions about free will seriously.\
  \ We talk about how we can move from knowledge about people\u2019s blameworthiness\
  \ to deciding how to punish them. We then discuss social justice, and much weight\
  \ we should attribute to the environmental conditions people live in, when judging\
  \ them. Finally, we talk about the concept of history, and its importance for moral\
  \ responsibility, and the role of moral luck.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Vargas\u2019\
