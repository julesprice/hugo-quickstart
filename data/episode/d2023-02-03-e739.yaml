  and aggression, hatred, and formidability estimation.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about the evolution of the emotions of anger and hatred.
  We star by discussing emotions from an evolutionary perspective. We talk about anger,
  its functions, what triggers it, and cues of strength. We then get into hatred,
  how it differs from anger, and their relationship with revenge and conflict. We
  talk about how males assess fighting ability. We discuss if emotions are adaptations.
  Finally, we talk about justice-making institutions, and ask if criminal justice
  is based on punishment or repair.</p>
