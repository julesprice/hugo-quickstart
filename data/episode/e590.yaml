shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 10th 2021.  \nThomas Costello is a Ph.D. Candidate\
  \ at Emory University. Certain personality traits, thinking styles, and worldviews\
  \ give rise to maladaptive political attitudes and behaviors, such as violence,\
  \ extreme partisanship, and authoritarianism. Thomas\u2019 research leverages the\
  \ tools and expertise of personality psychology and clinical science to understand,\
  \ measure, and statistically model the psychological causes and correlates of these\
  \ attitudes and behaviors.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about political attitudes,\
  \ authoritarianism, and sexual objectification. We discuss maladaptive and pathological\
  \ political attitudes and behaviors, and what distinguishes psychologically left-wing\
  \ from right-wing people. We dissect authoritarianism, its affective and cognitive\
  \ components, beliefs and motivational values associated with it, both on the left\
  \ and the right. We also ask why left-wing authoritarianism has been so neglected\
  \ in political psychology. Finally, we talk about sexual objectification, and the\
  \ personality traits and sex differences associated with it.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
