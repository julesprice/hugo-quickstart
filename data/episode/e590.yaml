shownotes: "<p>Thomas Costello is a Ph.D. Candidate at Emory University. Certain personality\
  \ traits, thinking styles, and worldviews give rise to maladaptive political attitudes\
  \ and behaviors, such as violence, extreme partisanship, and authoritarianism. Thomas\u2019\
  \ research leverages the tools and expertise of personality psychology and clinical\
  \ science to understand, measure, and statistically model the psychological causes\
  \ and correlates of these attitudes and behaviors.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk\
  \ about political attitudes, authoritarianism, and sexual objectification. We discuss\
  \ maladaptive and pathological political attitudes and behaviors, and what distinguishes\
  \ psychologically left-wing from right-wing people. We dissect authoritarianism,\
  \ its affective and cognitive components, beliefs and motivational values associated\
  \ with it, both on the left and the right. We also ask why left-wing authoritarianism\
  \ has been so neglected in political psychology. Finally, we talk about sexual objectification,\
  \ and the personality traits and sex differences associated with it.</p>\n"
