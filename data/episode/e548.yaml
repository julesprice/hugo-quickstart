shownotes: "<p>Dr. Todd Shackelford is a Distinguished Professor and Chair of Psychology\
  \ at Oakland University.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on The SAGE Handbook\
  \ of Evolutionary Psychology. We first get into what evolutionary psychology is,\
  \ and a bit of its history and theoretical bases. We then go through sex differences\
  \ (and how they derive from sexual selection and intrasexual competition), parental\
  \ investment, life history theory, attachment theory, Tinbergen\u2019s 4 questions,\
  \ and culture from an evolutionary perspective. We talk about the relationship between\
  \ evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, and the place of evolutionary\
  \ psychology in the broader context of psychology and the social sciences. We discuss\
  \ the insights we get by doing comparative psychology, and comparing ourselves to\
  \ other animals. We talk about the cross-cultural nature of evolutionary psychology\
  \ and if it has suffered from a replication crisis. We discuss studying morality\
  \ from an evolutionary perspective, and if evolutionary psychology can be prescriptive.\
  \ We talk about the politicization of evolutionary psychology. Finally, we discuss\
  \ the concept of evolutionary mismatch, and Dr. Shackelford tells about the questions\
  \ he would like to see tackled in evolutionary psychology.</p>\n"
