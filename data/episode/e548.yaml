shownotes: "Dr. Todd Shackelford is a Distinguished Professor and Chair of Psychology\
  \ at Oakland University, as well as the Co-Director of the Evolutionary Psychology\
  \ Lab there. He is the editor in chief of the academic journals Evolutionary Psychology\
  \ and Evolutionary Psychological Science. He is a fellow of the American Psychological\
  \ Association and the Association for Psychological Science.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on The SAGE Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology. We first get into what\
  \ evolutionary psychology is, and a bit of its history and theoretical bases. We\
  \ then go through sex differences (and how they derive from sexual selection and\
  \ intrasexual competition), parental investment, life history theory, attachment\
  \ theory, Tinbergen\u2019s 4 questions, and culture from an evolutionary perspective.\
  \ We talk about the relationship between evolutionary psychology and behavioral\
  \ genetics, and the place of evolutionary psychology in the broader context of psychology\
  \ and the social sciences. We discuss the insights we get by doing comparative psychology,\
  \ and comparing ourselves to other animals. We talk about the cross-cultural nature\
  \ of evolutionary psychology and if it has suffered from a replication crisis. We\
  \ discuss studying morality from an evolutionary perspective, and if evolutionary\
  \ psychology can be prescriptive. We talk about the politicization of evolutionary\
  \ psychology. Finally, we discuss the concept of evolutionary mismatch, and Dr.\
  \ Shackelford tells about the questions he would like to see tackled in evolutionary\
  \ psychology.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:39  What is evolutionary psychology?\
