shownotes: "<p>Dr. Elijah Millgram is a Professor of Philosophy at the University\
  \ of Utah. His research focuses on rationality, theoretical reasoning, and practical\
  \ reasoning. He is the author of six books, including Practical Induction, Varieties\
  \ of Practical Reasoning, Ethics Done Right: Practical Reasoning as a Foundation\
  \ for Moral Theory, and John Stuart Mill and the Meaning of Life.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we talk about practical reasoning. We start by discussing what practical\
  \ reasoning is, and the questions it applies to. We talk about different theories\
  \ of practical reasoning, and problems with means-end approaches. We discuss how\
  \ practical reasoning applies to ethics; Kant\u2019s practical reason; and how practical\
  \ reasoning relates to virtue ethics, consequentialism, and deontology. We discuss\
  \ if ethics is just a matter of preference. We also talk about the ways practical\
  \ reasoning can be wrong, how it differs from reflective equilibrium, and how to\
  \ deal with the issue of defeasibility.</p>\n"
