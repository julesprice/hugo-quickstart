  \ NOISE THAT YOU MIGHT HEAR THROUGHOUT THE VIDEO. I THINK DR. COSMIDES\u2019 VOICE\
  \ IS STILL VERY PERCEPTIBLE, BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THE NOISE MIGHT BE A BIT ANNOYING.\
  \ I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT ANYWAY.======\n\nDr. Leda Cosmides pioneered the field of\
  \ Evolutionary Psychology. She\u2019s got a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology by the\
  \ University of Harvard. Dr. Cosmides did postdoctoral work with Roger Shepard at\
  \ Stanford and was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.\
  \ Dr. Cosmides won the 1988 American Association for the Advancement of Science\
  \ Prize for Behavioral Science Research, the 1993 American Psychological Association\
  \ Distinguished Scientific Award for an Early Career Contribution to Psychology,\
  \ and a J. S. Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship. She is currently Professor of Psychology\
  \ at UC Santa Barbara. She and John Tooby founded and co-direct the UCSB Center\
  \ for Evolutionary Psychology. And she is also the co-author of the great book The\
  \ Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture.  \nHere,\
  \ we talk about what is the history and development of Evolutionary Psychology;\
  \ the problems with the Standard Social Science Model; the evolutionary environment\
  \ of adaptedness (EEA); adaptations, by-products, and noise; ultimate vs proximate\
  \ explanations; cognitive modules, and the problem with Jerry Fodor\u2019s approach\
  \ to them; variability and universality in human psychology and behavior; the application\
  \ to evolutionary psychology to stereotypes, politics and human relationships; literal\
  \ and metaphorical truth; and the view of human nature coming from evolutionary\
  \ psychology.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:01 Leda Cosmides vs Virgin Mary  \n02:50 History\
