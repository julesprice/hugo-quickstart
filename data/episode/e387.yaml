shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 4th 2020.  \nDr. Greg Eghigian is Professor of History\
  \ at Pennsylvania State University. A historian of both the human sciences and modern\
  \ Europe, he is particularly interested in how societies grapple with the questions\
  \ and problems associated with modernity through the vehicles of science, technology,\
  \ and medicine. His research has largely focused on the nature of power and the\
  \ relationship between the state, science, and medicine in understanding and managing\
  \ things such as disability, deviance, criminality, mental illness, and security.\
  \ And he regularly writes articles and present papers on the general history of\
  \ madness and psychiatry. In recent years, his interests have moved into studying\
  \ the history of supernatural and paranormal phenomena. \n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ talk about the history of mental illness and psychiatry. We discuss how to properly\
  \ address the history of mental illness, and the cultural and political elements\
  \ of mental illness. We address the questions of how mentally ill people were treated\
  \ in premodern times, if people thought they could be cured, and if they were always\
  \ stigmatized. Then, we talk about the advent of psychiatry, how people viewed suicide\
  \ historically, Foucault and the exercise of power over the mentally ill, and the\
  \ history of talk therapy. Finally, we ask if psychiatry is a science, and we discuss\
  \ the history of institutionalization and the deinstitutionalization movement in\
  \ psychiatry.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:07  How to properly think about mental illness\
