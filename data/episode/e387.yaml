shownotes: '<p>In this episode, we talk about the history of mental illness and psychiatry.
  We discuss how to properly address the history of mental illness, and the cultural
  and political elements of mental illness. We address the questions of how mentally
  ill people were treated in premodern times, if people thought they could be cured,
  and if they were always stigmatized. Then, we talk about the advent of psychiatry,
  how people viewed suicide historically, Foucault and the exercise of power over
  the mentally ill, and the history of talk therapy. Finally, we ask if psychiatry
  is a science, and we discuss the history of institutionalization and the deinstitutionalization
  movement in psychiatry.</p>
