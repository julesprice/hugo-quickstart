  <p>In this episode, we focus on philosophy of music, and go through how to properly\
  \ evaluate a piece of music, by itself and in its performative aspects, and we also\
  \ talk about the aesthetic purpose of music. Toward the end, we also discuss if\
  \ artists can also have a saying on human nature. And we finish by talking a bit\
  \ about modernist and postmodernist art, and if they really ruined the artistic\
  \ enterprise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:48 Can any person evaluate music?\
