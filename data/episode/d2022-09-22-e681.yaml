shownotes: "<p>Dr. Marjorie Prokosch is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Disasters, Trust,\
  \ and Social Change Lab at the University of Florida, and an incoming Assistant\
  \ Professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology. She studies social and health-related\
  \ decision-making, with an emphasis on how environmental threats and our own condition\
  \ motivate our perceptions and behavior. In her current role at UF, she is examining\
  \ how environmental hazards (like hurricanes) and climate change threats intersect\
  \ with social inequality to impact decision-making.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we\
  \ talk about harshness, the immune system, and climate change. We start with how\
  \ harshness impacts psychological development, and how it affects risk perception,\
  \ self-regulation, and close relationships. We talk about the connection between\
  \ the immune system and psychology and behavior. We discuss how threats of infectious\
  \ disease change behavior, and the implications for Public Health. Finally, we talk\
  \ about Dr. Prokosch\u2019s ongoing work on people\u2019s perceptions of climate\
  \ change, and its relationship with inequality.</p>\n"
