  \ we start off by talking about some of the main subjects covered by Dr. Saad\u2019\
  s work. First, I ask him to tell us why he decided to apply evolutionary theory\
  \ to consumer behavior. We then move on to talk about cultural artifacts as fossils\
  \ of the human mind, the four great cognitive pillars of consumer behavior, and\
  \ why some people have addictive behaviors. After I ask him if he has sold his soul\
  \ to the capitalist devil, we talk about the many ways intellectual terrorists try\
  \ to butcher evolutionary psychology, the entire field of Psychology, and even science\
  \ itself as an intellectual enterprise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>02:09\
