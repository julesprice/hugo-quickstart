  \ perspective. We discuss horror from an evolutionary perspective, and the sociocultural\
  \ factors behind it. We talk about the traits of monsters, and the different types\
  \ of horror. We talk about slasher movies, and apocalyptic stories. We get into\
  \ human universals in horror, what makes for popular monsters, and what makes some\
  \ films \u201Cso-bad-they\u2019re-good\u201D. We discuss the relationship between\
  \ personality traits and art appreciation. We discuss a study on the relationship\
  \ between being morbidly curious and more psychologically resilient during the COVID-19\
  \ pandemic. Finally, we talk about what an evolutionary approach adds to the picture\
  \ in literary studies.</p>\n"
