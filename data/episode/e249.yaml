shownotes: "Dr. Moshe Hoffman is a Research Scientist at MIT Media Lab & Lecturer\
  \ at Harvard's Department of Economics. He applies game theory, models of learning\
  \ and evolution, and experimental methods, to try to decipher the (often subconscious\
  \ and subtle) incentives that shape our social behavior, preferences, and ideologies.\
  \ Dr. Hoffman obtained his Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Chicago, Booth\
  \ School of Business and his B.S. in Economics from the University of Chicago. He\
  \ also co-designed and teaches \"Game Theory and Social Behavior\" which lays out\
  \ a lot of the evidence and models behind this approach.\n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ talk about problems in how people come up with explanations to social phenomena\
  \ in the social sciences, and more specifically, in social psychology. We discuss\
  \ the levels of analysis through which we can study social phenomena, and why intuitive\
  \ explanations don\u2019t work. We also refer to perverse incentives in the social\
  \ sciences. Dr. Hoffman then talks about the example of cognitive dissonance, and\
  \ the correct interpretation of the phenomenon. In the latter part of the interview,\
  \ we discuss the aspects of (social) behavior that evolutionary psychology explains\
  \ well, and where it fails or is not enough.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:55  Issues with\
