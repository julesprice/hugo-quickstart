  <p>In this episode, we focus on Chimpanzees, War, and History. We start by talking\
  \ about the history of the belief in a \u201Cdeath instinct\u201D and aggressive\
  \ drives, and what is war. We go through different cases of chimpanzee groups \u2013\
  \ Gombe, Mahale, and Kibale -, and get into detail about the Four-Year War; human\
  \ interference; chimp territoriality; the rise of sociobiology; the Imbalance of\
  \ Power Hypothesis; the Resource Competition Hypothesis; the Human Impact Hypothesis;\
  \ the Display Violence Hypothesis; when chimps resort to violence; the aftermath\
  \ of the war; and issues with counting killings. We discuss the best ways to study\
  \ violence in chimpanzees. We also talk about bonobos, and Dr. Ferguson\u2019s anthropological\
  \ theory of war.</p>\n"
