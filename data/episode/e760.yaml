shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 6th 2022.  \nDr. Jonathan Maynard is a Lecturer in\
  \ International Politics at King's College London's Department of Political Economy.\
  \ His research is primarily concerned with the role of ideology in collective political\
  \ violence, especially in forms of violence against civilians such as genocides,\
  \ mass atrocities and terrorism. He works more broadly on a range of subjects relating\
  \ to ideology, international security, violent conflict and political extremism,\
  \ and have secondary research interests in political and ethical theories of political\
  \ violence and political speech, and on methodological debates in political theory\
  \ and political science. He is the author of Ideology and Mass Killing: The Radicalized\
  \ Security Politics of Genocides and Deadly Atrocities.\n\nIn this episode, we focus\
  \ on Ideology and Mass Killing. We first define mass killings, and get into explanations\
  \ presented on the media; what ideology is; how ideologies can influence political\
  \ behavior; non-ideological explanations; and Dr. Maynard\u2019s neo-ideological\
  \ explanation. We discuss the \u201Ctrue believers\u201D, and how non-believers\
  \ can still be influenced; why mass killings take different forms; why they occur;\
  \ the role played by ideological propaganda and hate speech; if threats are ever\
  \ real; and if it is possible to predict and prevent mass killings.\n\n\nTime Links:\
