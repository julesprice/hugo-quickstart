shownotes: "<p>Dr. Andreas Elpidorou is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at the\
  \ University of Louisville. He specializes in the philosophical study of the mind\
  \ and has published extensively on the nature of emotions (especially, boredom),\
  \ consciousness, and cognition. He is best known for his work on the function and\
  \ value of boredom. He is the co-author of Consciousness and Physicalism: A Defense\
  \ of a Research Program (Routledge, 2018), the co-editor of Philosophy of Mind and\
  \ Phenomenology: Conceptual and Empirical Approaches (Routledge, 2016), and the\
  \ author of the recent book, Propelled: How Boredom, Frustration, and Anticipation\
  \ Lead us to the Good Life.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Propelled, and\
  \ talk about boredom, frustration and anticipation, from a philosophical perspective.\
  \ To put things into perspective, we first talk about Robert Nozick\u2019s experience\
  \ machine, and what it tells us about the role of negative emotions. We then address\
  \ boredom, frustration and anticipation, how they work, and their relationship with\
  \ other mental phenomena, like the experience of time, preferences, envy, the IKEA\
  \ effect, memory, and worldviews like optimism and pessimism. In the end, we talk\
  \ about how people can learn to deal with these emotions.</p>\n"
