  an Adjunct Professor at Utah Valley University, and the Communications Officer for
  the Human Behavior and Evolution Society. Her interests are in human sexual psychology
  and behavior, including application of life history theory and sperm competition
  theory.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on attachment theory and behavioral genetics. We dissect
  attachment theory, going through topics like the different attachment styles; their
  relationship with personality; what we know about the behavioral genetics of attachment;
  the shared and the non-shared environment; the evolution of attachment; and environment
  unpredictability. We discuss the relationship between anxious attachment and intimate
  partner violence. We talk about a recent paper on the effects of spanking on psychosocial
  outcomes. Finally, we discuss the relationship between behavioral genetics and evolutionary
  psychology, and we end with a question from a patron of the show.</p>
