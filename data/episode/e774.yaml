shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 5th 2023.  \nDr. Andrew Buskell is a Visiting Assistant\
  \ Professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s School of Public Policy.\
  \ His work analyses issues where human cognition, culture, politics, and biology\
  \ intersect. His current project examines the ontological and epistemic assumptions\
  \ underwriting cross-cultural comparison and their implications for research and\
  \ policy design. He is one of the co-organizers of the project \u2018Culture at\
  \ the Macro-Scale: Boundaries, Barriers, and Endogenous Change\u2018.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about cultural evolution. We start by discussing what cultural\
  \ evolution is, when it started, and its elements. We talk about a systems approach\
  \ to cultural evolution. We talk about cognitive novelties and how they arise. We\
  \ discuss cumulative culture, its different types (adaptiveness, complexity, efficiency,\
  \ and disparity), and the paradigmatic example of complex hominin technologies.\
  \ We talk about cultural groups, and demographic cultures. We discuss Kim Sterelny\u2019\
  s and Wengrow\u2019s and Graeber\u2019s accounts of the origins of hierarchy and\
  \ inequality. We ask if we need an extended evolutionary synthesis. Finally, we\
  \ talk about uniqueness in the life sciences.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n\
  00:54  What is cultural evolution, really?  \n07:56  When did cultural evolution\
  \ start?  \n13:29  The elements of culture, and how they interrelate  \n22:31  A\
  \ systems approach to cultural evolution  \n26:16  What are cognitive novelties,\

  \ types  \n44:25  Complex hominin technologies as paradigmatic instances of cumulative\
  \ culture  \n46:45  Cultural groups, and demographic cultures  \n51:32  The origins\
  \ of hierarchy and inequality. Who has the better account: Kim Sterelny, or David\
  \ Wengrow and David Graeber?  \n55:45  The extended evolutionary synthesis: is it\
  \ needed?  \n1:01:43  What is uniqueness in the life sciences, and what epistemic\
  \ implications does it have?  \n1:05:08  Follow Dr. Buskell\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\
