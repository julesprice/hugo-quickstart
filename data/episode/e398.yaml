shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 20th 2020.  \nDr. Stuart Russell is a Professor of\
  \ Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where he also holds\
  \ the Smith-Zadeh Chair in Engineering. He founded and leads the Center for Human-Compatible\
  \ Artificial Intelligence there. His research covers a wide range of topics in artificial\
  \ intelligence including machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, knowledge representation,\
  \ planning, real-time decision making, multitarget tracking, computer vision, computational\
  \ physiology, global seismic monitoring, and philosophical foundations. His current\
  \ concerns include the threat of autonomous weapons and the long-term future of\
  \ artificial intelligence and its relation to humanity. Dr. Russell is co-author\
  \ of the most popular textbook in the field of artificial intelligence: Artificial\
  \ Intelligence: A Modern Approach used in more than 1,400 universities in 128 countries.\
  \ His most recent book is Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem\
  \ of Control.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about artificial intelligence. We start\
  \ with what intelligence is, and what would human-level AI look like. We get into\
  \ what is worrisome about advanced AI systems, and the issue with value alignment.\
  \ We discuss different instances where AI is already impacting our lives, and where\
  \ it will progress in the future, including the impact it will have on the job market.\
  \ We also talk about possible solutions, and if we should be worried about how we\
  \ treat AI systems.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:49  What is intelligence?  \n02:28  Human-level\
