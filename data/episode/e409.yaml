shownotes: '<p>In this episode, we focus on evolutionary psychology. We talk about
  the evolution of orgasm in males and females, and the functions that it serves,
  sperm competition, intra-copulatory competition, the sedative and antidepressant
  properties of semen. We also tackle paternity uncertainty, and the mating strategies
  that men and women resort to, particularly applied to mate guarding and infidelity.
  Then we discuss self-recognition and self-awareness in humans and other animals.
  Finally, we talk about what is a mind (and if other species have minds), tonic immobility,
  and religion.</p>
