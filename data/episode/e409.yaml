shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 14th 2020.  \nDr. Gordon Gallup is Professor in the\
  \ Department of Psychology at the University of Albany. He is best known for developing\
  \ the mirror test, also called the mirror self-recognition test, or MSR, in 1970,\
  \ which gauges self-awareness of animals. He also studied tonic immobility, or \"\
  animal hypnosis,\". His later work on animal behavior focused on ethological approaches\
  \ to the study of animal behavior under laboratory conditions. Since the 1990s,\
  \ Dr. Gallup has researched human evolutionary psychology exclusively.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on evolutionary psychology. We talk about the evolution of orgasm\
  \ in males and females, and the functions that it serves, sperm competition, intra-copulatory\
  \ competition, the sedative and antidepressant properties of semen. We also tackle\
  \ paternity uncertainty, and the mating strategies that men and women resort to,\
  \ particularly applied to mate guarding and infidelity. Then we discuss self-recognition\
  \ and self-awareness in humans and other animals. Finally, we talk about what is\
  \ a mind (and if other species have minds), tonic immobility, and religion.\n\n\
