  <p>In this episode, we talk about consciousness, theory of mind, moral judgment,\
  \ and cross-cultural studies of the human mind. We start with consciousness, and\
  \ we discuss the role that it plays and what functions it might serve from an evolutionary\
  \ perspective. Then, we talk about theory of mind, and we question if a mentalistic\
  \ basis of morality, and more specifically moral judgment, is found across all societies,\
  \ or is culturally variable. In the second part of the talk, we mention the WEIRD\
  \ problem, and how to improve the science of the human mind, develop a true cognitive\
  \ science of the human mind, and improve psychological studies.</p>\n"
