  In this episode, we focus on Mind in Motion. We start with the concept of cognitive\
  \ map. We discuss embodied cognition. We then talk about gestures, and how they\
  \ aid communication and learning. Other topics include: the relationship between\
  \ the how we perceive space and how we perceive time, and between space and how\
  \ we think about our social environments; how we move from the way we perceive the\
  \ world to concepts and abstractions; how to improve learning, and using virtual\
  \ and augmented reality; and creativity.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:57\
