  \ embodied cognition. We then talk about gestures, and how they aid communication\
  \ and learning. Other topics include: the relationship between the how we perceive\
  \ space and how we perceive time, and between space and how we think about our social\
  \ environments; how we move from the way we perceive the world to concepts and abstractions;\
  \ how to improve learning, and using virtual and augmented reality; and creativity.</p>\n"
