shownotes: '<p>Dr. Olivier Sibony is Associate Professor at HEC Paris. He is a writer,
  educator and consultant specializing in strategy, strategic decision making and
  the organization of decision processes. His research interests center on the effect
  of heuristics and biases in strategic decision making and procedures to improve
  the quality of decisions. He is the author of Cracked It!, You''re About to Make
  a Terrible Mistake, and, more recently, Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on Noise. We start with some definitions of judgment,
  biases, and noise. We discuss if noise has causes behind it. We talk about noise
  in specific instances, like regular vs. recurrent decisions, and give examples in
  hiring decisions, insurance, student evaluation, criminal punishment, medicine,
  weather forecasting, and others. We also talk about predictive judgment. We tackle
  issues like group polarization and the wisdom of crowds. Finally, we talk about
  solutions to tackle noise.</p>
