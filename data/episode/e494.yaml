shownotes: "<p>Dr. Carole Hooven is Co-Director of Undergraduate Studies and Lecturer\
  \ in Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. Her research Interests include\
  \ behavioral endocrinology and evolution of sex differences in humans (physiology,\
  \ behavior and cognition). She is the author of T: The Story of Testosterone, the\
  \ Hormone that Dominates and Divides Us.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on T.\
  \ We start with some basics, and talk about the physiological processes testosterone\
  \ participates in, and the activational-organizational paradigm. We then discuss\
  \ the behavioral effects of testosterone, and what we know about them in infants\
  \ and other closely-related species. We get into Wingfield\u2019s Challenge Hypothesis.\
  \ We ask if testosterone really does cause aggression, and how it correlates with\
  \ status-competition. We talk about conditions like Complete Androgen Insensitivity\
  \ Syndrome (CAIS) and Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). We ask how sex is defined.\
  \ We get into some political questions, like transgender athletes, and testosterone\
  \ in sports. We discuss the concept of \u201Ctoxic masculinity\u201D. Finally, we\
  \ talk about the difficulties with communicating this kind of science.</p>\n"
