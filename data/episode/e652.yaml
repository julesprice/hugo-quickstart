shownotes: '<p>Dr. Steven Frank is Donald Bren Professor &amp; UCI Distinguished Professor
  of Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology in the School of Biological Sciences at the
  University of California, Irvine. His areas of expertise are evolutionary genetics,
  host-parasite interactions and social evolution. He is the author of books like
  Foundations of Social Evolution, Immunology and Evolution of Infectious Disease,
  and more recently, Microbial Life History: The Fundamental Forces of Biological
  Design.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on Microbial Life History. We start with general questions
  related to biological design; three fundamental forces of design: marginal values;
  reproductive values; generalized kin selection; evolutionary and organismal responses
  to the environment; how to know what selective pressures produce a trait; predicting
  changes in traits; the origins versus the modification of traits; genetic and phenotypic
  changes; the evolution of phenotypic plasticity; and adaptationism. We then talk
  about aspects of microbial metabolism, like growth; thermodynamics; flux; and enzyme
  catalysts. Finally, we discuss the principles of biological design.</p>
