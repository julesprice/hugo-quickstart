shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 22nd 2022.  \nDr. Steven Frank is Donald Bren Professor\
  \ & UCI Distinguished Professor of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology in the School\
  \ of Biological Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. His areas of expertise\
  \ are evolutionary genetics, host-parasite interactions and social evolution. He\
  \ is the author of books like Foundations of Social Evolution, Immunology and Evolution\
  \ of Infectious Disease, and more recently, Microbial Life History: The Fundamental\
  \ Forces of Biological Design.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Microbial Life History.\
  \ We start with general questions related to biological design; three fundamental\
  \ forces of design: marginal values; reproductive values; generalized kin selection;\
  \ evolutionary and organismal responses to the environment; how to know what selective\
  \ pressures produce a trait; predicting changes in traits; the origins versus the\
  \ modification of traits; genetic and phenotypic changes; the evolution of phenotypic\
  \ plasticity; and adaptationism. We then talk about aspects of microbial metabolism,\
  \ like growth; thermodynamics; flux; and enzyme catalysts. Finally, we discuss the\
  \ principles of biological design.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:53  Design,\

  \ and organismal responses to the environment  \n16:34  The selective pressures\

  \  The origins vs. the modification of traits  \n34:37  What changes first, genes\
  \ or the phenotype?  \n42:30  The evolution of phenotypic plasticity  \n45:53  Adaptationism\
