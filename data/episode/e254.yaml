shownotes: "<p>Dr. Michael Gurven is a Professor at the Department of Anthropology\
  \ at the University of California, Santa Barbara, chair of the Integrative Anthropological\
  \ Sciences Unit, and also head of the Evolutionary Anthropology and Biodemography\
  \ Research Group. He is an evolutionary anthropologist aiming to explain behavior\
  \ and physiological systems as adaptive solutions to competing demands of limited\
  \ resource allocation. He employs ethnographic field settings as laboratories for\
  \ testing hypotheses about human variation in behavior, psychology and physiology.\
  \ Currently his research focuses on two broad, inter-related areas: biodemography\
  \ of human health, lifespan and aging; and transitions in social and economic behavior.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we first talk about limited resource allocation, and how people\
  \ have to make trade-offs when investing their material and time resources. Then\
  \ we discuss how we can use economic games to study human behavior. We talk about\
  \ marriage and the sexual division of labor, and also mate preferences. We also\
  \ cover a recent study about the relationship between wealth inequality and polygyny.\
  \ Finally, we discuss human personality, the problems with the apparent lack of\
  \ universality of the Big Five, and the niche diversity hypothesis of personality.</p>\n\
