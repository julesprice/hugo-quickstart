shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 21st 2022.  \nDr. Krister Bykvist is Professor in\
  \ Practical Philosophy at the Department of Philosophy at Stockholm University and\
  \ Research Fellow at the Institute for Future Studies. He has been a visiting researcher\
  \ at the Department of Philosophy, Canada, and at SCAS, Uppsala. His research concerns\
  \ questions about our responsibility for future generations, the foundations of\
  \ consequentialism, evaluative uncertainty (\u2019What should we do when we are\
  \ not certain about our values?\u2019), and the relationship between preferences,\
  \ value, and welfare. He is leading the project \u2018Valuing Future Lives\u2019\
  \ (funded by the Swedish Research Council), and Gustaf Arrhenius is my main co-researcher.\
  \ He is the author of Moral Uncertainty.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about metaethics.\
  \ We start by discussing what the most basic questions in metaethics are, how ethics\
  \ can be objective, and the metaphysical status of moral facts. We talk about the\
  \ relationship between preferences, values, and wellbeing. We get into population\
  \ ethics, and discuss questions related to future demographics, climate change,\
  \ and social security. Finally, we discuss antinatalism, if life is worth starting,\
  \ and if we can determine objectively the amount of good and bad in human life.\n\
