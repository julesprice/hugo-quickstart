shownotes: "<p>Dr. Patrick Lee Miller is an associate professor of Philosophy at Duquesne\
  \ University, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He is the author of Becoming God: Pure\
  \ Reason in Early Greek Philosophy (Bloomsbury, 2012), and co-editor of Introductory\
  \ Readings in Ancient Greek and Roman Philosophy (Hackett, 2015).</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we talk about Nietzsche and Plato. We start by talking about Nietzsche\u2019\
  s phases in his writings, and ask if The Will to Power should be considered canon.\
  \ We discuss why we can compare Nietzsche and Plato. And then we get into some of\
  \ the aspects of their philosophies, and where they diverge and converge, including:\
  \ the Dionysian, the Apollonian, and the Greek poets; their metaphysics; the Eternal\
  \ Return, and time as linear or circular; slave and master morality; Plato\u2019\
  s Republic, hierarchy, and democracy; and the differences between the Philosopher\
  \ King and the \xDCbermensch.</p>\n"
