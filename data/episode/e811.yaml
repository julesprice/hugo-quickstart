shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 15th 2023.  \nDr. Elijah Millgram is a Professor of\
  \ Philosophy at the University of Utah. His research focuses on rationality, theoretical\
  \ reasoning, and practical reasoning. He is the author of six books, including Practical\
  \ Induction, Varieties of Practical Reasoning, Ethics Done Right: Practical Reasoning\
  \ as a Foundation for Moral Theory, and John Stuart Mill and the Meaning of Life.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about practical reasoning. We start by discussing what\
  \ practical reasoning is, and the questions it applies to. We talk about different\
  \ theories of practical reasoning, and problems with means-end approaches. We discuss\
  \ how practical reasoning applies to ethics; Kant\u2019s practical reason; and how\
  \ practical reasoning relates to virtue ethics, consequentialism, and deontology.\
  \ We discuss if ethics is just a matter of preference. We also talk about the ways\
  \ practical reasoning can be wrong, how it differs from reflective equilibrium,\
  \ and how to deal with the issue of defeasibility.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
