shownotes: "<p>Dr. Robert Plomin is Professor of Behavioural Genetics at the Social\
  \ Genetic &amp; Developmental Psychiatry Center at King\u2019s College London, and\
  \ Research Professor at the Medical Research Council (MRC). He\u2019s one of the\
  \ leading figures in the entire field of Behavioral Genetics. A Review of General\
  \ Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Dr. Plomin as the 71st most cited\
  \ psychologist of the 20th century. And he\u2019s also the author of many books,\
  \ including Behavioral Genetics: A Primer (1989), Separate Lives: Why Siblings Are\
  \ So Different (1992), Nature And Nurture: An Introduction To Human Behavioral Genetics\
  \ (2004), Nature and Nurture During Infancy and Early Childhood (2006), G Is for\
  \ Genes (2013), and, the most recent one, Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are\
  \ (2018).</p>\n<p>In this episode, we start off by talking about the history and\
  \ development of the field of Behavioral Genetics. We also address the issue of\
  \ environmentalism in Psychology and the behavioral sciences. We also go through\
  \ some of the basic concepts in Behavioral Genetics, like heritability, gene-environment\
  \ correlations, and twin and adoptee studies. We also tackle the problems with environmental\
  \ factors in human behavior. We also deal with GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies),\
  \ polygenic scores and the type of information we can obtain from them and what\
  \ we can do with it. We also talk about how clinical psychology and psychiatry should\
  \ revise the way they classify mental conditions, moving from a qualitative to a\
  \ quantitative approach, and some of the current limitations in these fields. Toward\
  \ the end, we also briefly discuss the potential of gene editing technologies.</p>\n\
