shownotes: "Dr. Robert Plomin is Professor of Behavioural Genetics at the Social Genetic\
  \ & Developmental Psychiatry Center at King\u2019s College London, and Research\
  \ Professor at the Medical Research Council (MRC). He\u2019s one of the leading\
  \ figures in the entire field of Behavioral Genetics. A Review of General Psychology\
  \ survey, published in 2002, ranked Dr. Plomin as the 71st most cited psychologist\
  \ of the 20th century. And he\u2019s also the author of many books, including Behavioral\
  \ Genetics: A Primer (1989), Separate Lives: Why Siblings Are So Different (1992),\
  \ Nature And Nurture: An Introduction To Human Behavioral Genetics (2004), Nature\
  \ and Nurture During Infancy and Early Childhood (2006), G Is for Genes (2013),\
  \ and, the most recent one, Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are (2018).\n\nIn\
  \ this episode, we start off by talking about the history and development of the\
  \ field of Behavioral Genetics. We also address the issue of environmentalism in\
  \ Psychology and the behavioral sciences. We also go through some of the basic concepts\
  \ in Behavioral Genetics, like heritability, gene-environment correlations, and\
  \ twin and adoptee studies. We also tackle the problems with environmental factors\
  \ in human behavior. We also deal with GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies), polygenic\
  \ scores and the type of information we can obtain from them and what we can do\
  \ with it. We also talk about how clinical psychology and psychiatry should revise\
  \ the way they classify mental conditions, moving from a qualitative to a quantitative\
  \ approach, and some of the current limitations in these fields. Toward the end,\
  \ we also briefly discuss the potential of gene editing technologies.\n\nTime Links:\
