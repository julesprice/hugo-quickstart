shownotes: "<p>Dr. Ann-Sophie Barwich is Assistant Professor of History and Philosophy\
  \ of Science and Cognitive Science at Indiana University Bloomington. She is a cognitive\
  \ scientist and empirical philosopher &amp; historian of science, technology, and\
  \ the senses. She divides her brain-time between the Department of History &amp;\
  \ Philosophy of Science and the Cognitive Science Program. Estimated begin of lab\
  \ (EEG/Olfactometry) in early 2021. She\u2019s the author of Smellosophy: What the\
  \ Nose tells the Mind.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we start off by talking about the\
  \ scientific method, how it evolved over time, the difficulties in defining or characterizing\
  \ it. We refer to the fact that different branches of science and of philosophy\
  \ of science approach their objects of study in different ways; the place for fiction\
  \ in science, and how we should think about modelling in science; empirical success;\
  \ a minority view on the replication crisis, and the importance of failure in the\
  \ scientific process; falsification, and the demarcation problem. Then, we get into\
  \ Dr. Barwich\u2019s work on the sense of olfaction, how it works, and a new view\
  \ it gives us of how the brain works more broadly, and also how it reframes certain\
  \ questions and big topics in the philosophy of neuroscience.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow\
