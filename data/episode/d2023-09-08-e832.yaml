  \ Naturalist Association. She is the author of The Sacred Depths of Nature: How\
  \ Life Has Emerged and Evolved.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on\
  \ The Sacred Depths of Nature. We talk about \u201Cwhy\u201D questions surrounding\
  \ existence, meaning, purpose, and developing a sense of mystery. We go through\
  \ topics in evolutionary biology, like the origins of life; biochemistry and emergence;\
  \ the self; the origins of evolution and biodiversity; the evolution of multicellular\
  \ organisms; sexual reproduction, and the evolution of nurture; and death. We discuss\
  \ the tenets of Religious Naturalism, and the intellectual schism between religion\
  \ and science. We talk about the existential, spiritual, and moral domains of Religious\
  \ Naturalism. We discuss how it deals with traditional religions, how science can\
  \ elicit religious-like responses from people, and the risk of nihilism.</p>\n"
