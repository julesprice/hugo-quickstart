shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 22nd 2023.  \nDr. Adam Bulley is a postdoctoral fellow\
  \ at the Brain and Mind Centre and School of Psychology, The University of Sydney,\
  \ and the Department of Psychology at Harvard University. In his research he uses\
  \ the tools of evolutionary and cognitive psychology to study the mind and human\
  \ behavior. Specifically, he investigates the evolution, development, and psychological\
  \ mechanisms of imagination, foresight, decision-making, and emotion. He is the\
  \ author (together with Thomas Suddendorf and Jonathan Redshaw) of The Invention\
  \ of Tomorrow: A Natural History of Foresight.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The\
  \ Invention of Tomorrow. We start with the evolution of foresight; and talk about\
  \ life history theory, and how foresight is a universal human trait. We discuss\
  \ its development. We get into the particular case of the Pirah\xE3. We talk about\
  \ foresight in other animals and extinct hominin species. We discuss the neuroscience\
  \ of foresight, and how it relates to memory, including how dementia affects both\
  \ memory and foresight. We discuss how foresight might have driven cultural evolution,\
  \ and how cultural artifacts enhance foresight. Finally, we talk about the role\
  \ of foresight in the development of the modern era, particularly the scientific\
  \ method, and we discuss if people in industrialized societies really have longer\
  \ time horizons.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:54  The evolution of foresight\
