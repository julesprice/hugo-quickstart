  Capitalism, Alone\u201D. We start by defining capitalism, and distinguishing mainly\
  \ between political capitalism and liberal meritocratic capitalism. We talk about\
  \ China\u2019s political capitalism, and the historical role of communism. We get\
  \ into economic inequality, and discuss how it is measured, recent trends, what\
  \ drives it, if it is a problem, and how to reduce it. We discuss specifically Universal\
  \ Basic Income as a proposed solution. Finally, we ask if capitalism has been a\
  \ net-positive for global society, and if it is possible to predict its future.</p>\n"
