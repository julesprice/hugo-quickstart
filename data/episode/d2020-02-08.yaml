shownotes: "<p>In order to sustain the channel, I need your help.</p>\n<p>For these\
  \ past two years, I have brought on the show some of the top academics/scholars\
  \ in a diversity of fields, like Psychology, Anthropology, Cognitive Science, Neuroscience,\
  \ Philosophy, and even Literary Studies.</p>\n<p>Some of the biggest names that\
  \ appeared throughout my 300 interviews include: Noam Chomsky, Jerome Kagan, Randy\
  \ Thornhill, Dale Purves, Michael Ruse, David Buss, Simon Blackburn, Alexander Rosenberg,\
  \ Terrence Deacon, Richard Shweder, Diane Halpern, Robert Plomin, David Sloan Wilson,\
  \ Richard Wrangham, Azar Gat, David C. Geary, Leda Cosmides, Todd Shackelford, Diana\
  \ Fleischman, Don Ross, Gad Saad, Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, Patricia Churchland,\
  \ David Barash, Peter Singer, Martin Daly, David Benatar, Paul Slovic, Glenn Geher,\
  \ Lars Penke, Kevin Mitchell, Randolph Nesse, Bo Winegard, Cory Clark, Peter DeScioli,\
  \ Daniel Nettle, Steve Stewart-Williams, Paul Slovic, Robert Trivers, Helen Fisher,\
  \ Richard Haier, Nicole Barbaro, Pascal Boyer, Steven Hayes, Lee Cronk, Chris Stringer,\
  \ Lyn Wadley, Donald Hoffman, Cecilia Heyes, Nicholas Humphrey, Indre Viskontas,\
  \ Nicholas Christakis, Daniel Lieberman, Marco Del Giudice, Peter Ungar, Alice Eagly,\
  \ Daniel Everett, and many others.</p>\n<p>On my show, you can certainly find informative,\
  \ well-researched, engaging, and fun interviews on topics that will feed your intellectual\
  \ interest.</p>\n<p>My income for these past two years has depended completely on\
  \ the donations made by my charitable patrons and Paypal supporters, but, unfortunately,\
  \ it is not enough.</p>\n<p>In today\u2019s society, scientific literacy is ever\
  \ more important, and, hopefully, I have been contributing to spread knowledge outside\
  \ of academia in a format that I try my best to be accessible even to laypeople.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  <p>So I ask you to please consider supporting me on the platforms I will link down\
  \ below.</p>\n<p>As a teaser, and if you become a patron of mine, you will be on\
  \ time to send me questions to pose to people like Steven Pinker and Robert Sapolsky,\
  \ who I will be interviewing in March. You will also get a wealth of other benefits.</p>\n\
  <p>I am leaving a link to my Patreon page and links to monthly subscriptions on\
  \ Paypal, and also a link to Paypal for a one-time big donation, if you prefer,\
  \ if any of you would be generous enough to become a patron or give me a one-time\
  \ big donation.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/thedissenter</p>\n\
