shownotes: "<p>Dr. Jennifer Vonk is Professor of comparative/cognitive psychology\
  \ at Oakland University. Her primary research interests are in two overlapping areas:\
  \ animal cognition, and cognitive development. The underlying goal of her work is\
  \ to examine cognitive continuities and discontinuities between humans and both\
  \ closely and distantly related species.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this episode, Dr. Vonk\
  \ joins me to talk about what is comparative psychology; how we can apply evolutionary\
  \ principles to better compare cognition between different species; the importance\
  \ of studying how a trait develops during the lifetime of a species; the problem\
  \ with anthropocentric approaches to studying other species; in what ways humans\
  \ are different, and also how other animals might have some superior abilities;\
  \ and, finally, the issue with studying animals in the wild and in the lab.</p>\n\
