shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 22nd 2021.  \nDr. Dan Sperber is a researcher at the\
  \ Institut Jean Nicod, and a professor in cognitive science and philosophy at the\
  \ Central European University in Budapest. He is Corresponding Fellow of the British\
  \ Academy, Foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,\
  \ and member of the Academia Europaea. He has been the first laureate of the Claude\
  \ L\xE9vi-Strauss Prize in 2009. He is the author of numerous articles in anthropology,\
  \ linguistics, philosophy and psychology and of several books, including Meaning\
  \ and Relevance (with Deirdre Wilson), Relevance: Communication and Cognition (with\
  \ Deirdre Wilson), and The Enigma of Reason (with Hugo Mercier).\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about cultural evolution, cultural attraction theory, epistemic vigilance,\
  \ and reason. We start by talking about how human cognition is best understood in\
  \ a social context, and how to think about the relationship between culture and\
  \ biology. We then get into Dr. Sperber\u2019s \u201Cepidemiology of representations\u201D\
  , and into cultural attraction theory, and how it related to Robert Boyd\u2019s\
  \ and Peter Richerson\u2019s approach to cultural evolution. We discuss the limitations\
  \ of memetics, and if we can say that cultural evolution is Darwinian. We talk about\
  \ epistemic vigilance, and the argumentative theory of reasoning. Finally, Dr. Sperber\
  \ tells us about his take on massive modularity of the human mind, and why reason\
  \ is modular.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:42  Studying human cognition in\
