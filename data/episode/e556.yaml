shownotes: "<p>Dr. Dan Sperber is a researcher at the Institut Jean Nicod, and a professor\
  \ in cognitive science and philosophy at the Central European University in Budapest.\
  \ He is the author of numerous articles in anthropology, linguistics, philosophy\
  \ and psychology and of several books, including Meaning and Relevance (with Deirdre\
  \ Wilson), Relevance: Communication and Cognition (with Deirdre Wilson), and The\
  \ Enigma of Reason (with Hugo Mercier).</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about cultural\
  \ evolution, cultural attraction theory, epistemic vigilance, and reason. We start\
  \ by talking about how human cognition is best understood in a social context, and\
  \ how to think about the relationship between culture and biology. We then get into\
  \ Dr. Sperber\u2019s \u201Cepidemiology of representations\u201D, and into cultural\
  \ attraction theory, and how it related to Robert Boyd\u2019s and Peter Richerson\u2019\
  s approach to cultural evolution. We discuss the limitations of memetics, and if\
  \ we can say that cultural evolution is Darwinian. We talk about epistemic vigilance,\
  \ and the argumentative theory of reasoning. Finally, Dr. Sperber tells us about\
  \ his take on massive modularity of the human mind, and why reason is modular.</p>\n"
