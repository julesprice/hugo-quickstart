shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 29th 2022.  \nDr. Marjorie Prokosch is a Postdoctoral\
  \ Scholar in the Disasters, Trust, and Social Change Lab at the University of Florida,\
  \ and an incoming Assistant Professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology.\
  \ She studies social and health-related decision-making, with an emphasis on how\
  \ environmental threats (such as the threat posed by infectious disease) and our\
  \ own condition (e.g., our immune system, developmental experiences with harshness)\
  \ motivate our perceptions and behavior. Specific areas of interest include risk\
  \ perception, self-regulation, and close relationships. In her current role at UF,\
  \ she is examining how environmental hazards (like hurricanes) and climate change\
  \ threats intersect with social inequality to impact decision-making.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about harshness, the immune system, and climate change. We start\
  \ with how harshness impacts psychological development, and how it affects risk\
  \ perception, self-regulation, and close relationships. We talk about the connection\
  \ between the immune system and psychology and behavior. We discuss how threats\
  \ of infectious disease change behavior, and the implications for Public Health.\
  \ Finally, we talk about Dr. Prokosch\u2019s ongoing work on people\u2019s perceptions\
  \ of climate change, and its relationship with inequality.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
