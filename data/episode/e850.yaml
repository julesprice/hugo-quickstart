  \ McCann is Professor Emeritus of History at Boston University. Dr. McCann\u2019\
  s research and teaching interests include agricultural and ecological history of\
  \ Africa, Ethiopia, and the Horn of Africa, field research methods in African studies,\
  \ the agro-ecology of tropical disease, and the history of food/cuisine in Africa\
  \ and the Atlantic world. He is the author of books like Stirring the Pot: A History\
  \ of African Cuisine; Maize and Grace: A History of Africa\u2019s Encounter with\
  \ a New World Crop; People of the Plow: An Agricultural History of Ethiopia; and\
  \ From Poverty to Famine in Northeast Ethiopia: Rural History, 1900-1995.\n\nIn\
  \ this episode, we focus on Maize and Grace. We talk about maize and its main traits\
  \ as a crop. We discuss how it spread across the globe, and particularly, how it\
  \ got to Africa. We talk about the role of politics and economics in the spread\
  \ of maize across Africa, and we get into the illustrative example of southern Africa,\
  \ and how how politics, science, and race intermingled there. We discuss the impact\
  \ of maize on Africa\u2019s biodiversity and the health and nutrition of African\
  \ people. We talk about how colonialism influenced the spread of crops across the\
  \ globe. We discuss the causal relationship between climate and history. Finally,\
  \ we discuss the work of Jared Diamond, and the idea of geographical determinism.\n\
