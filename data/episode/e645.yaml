shownotes: '<p>Dr. Steven Churchill is a Professor and past Chair of the Department
  of Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University. He is also an Honorary Reader in
  the Evolutionary Studies Institute and Centre for Excellence in PalaeoSciences at
  the University of the Witwatersrand. He is a paleontologist who studies the fossil
  record of human evolution, especially that of early members of our genus (Homo)
  that lived between about two million to ten thousand years ago.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about aspects of human evolution. We start by asking
  where it starts. We talk about anatomical features anthropologists use to classify
  fossils, the classification of species, and determining the sex of a specimen. We
  get deep into Homo naledi and Australopithecus sediba, two new species discovered
  by Dr. Churchill and his collaborators. We go through the timeline of our evolution
  since H. erectus. We discuss the oldest hominin species, and how to compare hominins
  behaviorally with other apes, primates and other animal groups. We talk about behavioral
  modernity, and the role of self-domestication in our evolution. Finally, we discuss
  how speculative is the history of human evolution.</p>
