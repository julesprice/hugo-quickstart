  \ scientist, health economist, writer and artist. He teaches at Columbia University\
  \ and has decades of experience in the public sector, private sector and academia.\
  \ He has authored/co-authored about 100 scientific articles and book chapters in\
  \ areas of data science, applied statistics, health economics and politics. In June\
  \ 2012, Prometheus Books released his book Measure of a Nation. This book focuses\
  \ on how to improve America by first comparing its performance with thirteen competitive\
  \ industrial nations, then identifying the best practices found throughout the world\
  \ that can be adopted here in the United States. Measure of a Nation was named by\
  \ Jared Diamond as the best book of 2012 in an interview published in the New York\
  \ Times.  His most recent release, Ultimate Price: The Value We Place on Life, has\
  \ been covered by major media including National Public Radio and the journal Science\
  \ and is being translated into a number of foreign languages.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about Dr. Howard\u2019s book, Ultimate Price. We discuss how the monetary\
  \ value of a human life is calculated, and how it applies in several different instances,\
  \ including the private and the public sector, the criminal justice system, the\
  \ health system, life insurance, health insurance, the decision to have children,\
  \ and war. We also talk about how we value humans lives in the covid-19 pandemic,\
  \ and why we need regulation in capitalist societies.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:55  The\
