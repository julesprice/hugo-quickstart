shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 7th 2022.  \nDr. Joel Marks is professor emeritus\
  \ of philosophy at the University of New Haven and a Bioethics Center Scholar at\
  \ Yale University. His main areas of scholarly interest have been theoretical and\
  \ applied ethics, both having come together in recent years in thinking about animal\
  \ ethics. Meanwhile a new area of interest is planetary defense (against comets\
  \ and asteroids). He is the author of several books, including Ethics Without Morals:\
  \ In Defense of Amorality; It's Just a Feeling: The Philosophy of Desirism; Hard\
  \ Atheism and the Ethics of Desire: An Alternative to Morality; and Reason and Ethics:\
  \ The Case Against Objective Value.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about morality,\
  \ amorality, desirism, and animal ethics. We start by asking if morality exists.\
  \ We discuss the problematic aspects of morality \u2013 being angry, hypocritical,\
  \ arrogant, arbitrary, imprudent, and silly. We talk about the alternative of amorality,\
  \ and desirism, and how it applies to animal ethics.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
