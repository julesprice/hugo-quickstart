shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 6th 2022.  \nDr. Stephen Darwall is the Andrew Downey\
  \ Orrick Professor of Philosophy at Yale University. He is deeply interested in\
  \ moral philosophy and its history, and is focused on questions around the nature\
  \ of moral obligation and well-being.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about some concepts\
  \ in moral philosophy. We talk about Dr. Darwall\u2019s take on \u201Cmorality as\
  \ accountability\u201D, and how morality is objective. We discuss concepts such\
  \ as moral obligation (and duty), moral respect, moral rights, and dignity. We talk\
  \ about the interplay between morality and the law. We discuss the second-person\
  \ standpoint, second-person morality, and how we move from it to a universal morality.\
  \ Finally, we talk about the relationship between moral philosophy and moral psychology.\n\
