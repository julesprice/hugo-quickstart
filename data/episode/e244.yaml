shownotes: "Dr. Ruth Feldman is the Simms-Mann Professor of Developmental Social Neuroscience\
  \ at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzlia with joint appointment at Yale Child\
  \ Study Center. With degrees in music composition (summa cum-laude), neuroscience\
  \ (with honors), clinical psychology (with honors), and developmental psychology\
  \ and psychopathology, her approach integrates perspectives from neuroscience, human\
  \ development, philosophy, clinical practice, and the arts within an interpersonal\
  \ frame and a behavior-based approach.  Her conceptual model on biobehavioral synchrony\
  \ systematically describes how a lived experience within close relationships builds\
  \ brains, creates relationships, confers resilience, and promotes creativity.  Her\
  \ studies were the first to detail the role of oxytocin in the formation of human\
  \ social bonds. Her studies often follow children from infancy to adulthood, address\
  \ topics that are highly relevant to the general public, and receive substantial\
  \ media attention. Dr. Feldman is a fellow of the Association for Psychological\
  \ Science and received multiple awards, including a Rothschild award, NARSAD independent\
  \ investigator award (twice), the Zeskind award for best paper in Biological Psychiatry,\
  \ and the Graven\u2019s Award for research on high-risk infants.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on the neurobiology of attachment. We talk about the evolution of attachment,\
  \ the oxytocin system, and parental investment; biobehavioral synchrony between\
  \ parent and offspring; how events like postpartum depression, premature birth,\
  \ and early trauma can disrupt development; and individual and sex differences in\
  \ predisposition for resilience.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:48  The neurobiology of attachment,\
