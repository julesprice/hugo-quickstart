shownotes: "<p>Dr. Rebecca Sear is a demographer and anthropologist at the London\
  \ School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), teaching demography and researching\
  \ human reproductive behavior from an\nevolutionary perspective. She is particularly\
  \ interested in taking a comparative perspective to understanding human reproductive\
  \ behavior, and exploring why such behavior varies between, as well as within,\n\
  populations.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we start by talking about the study\
  \ of human demography, and what we can learn from it. We discuss the myth of the\
  \ nuclear family as the traditional family structure, child rearing in\ntraditional\
  \ societies, if children really need a parent from each sex at home, if father absence\
  \ leads to poverty, and the negative effects of this myth on children and parents.\
  \ We talk about how gendered division of labor develops in human societies. We discuss\
  \ life history theory, and issues in how it has been applied to humans. We talk\
  \ about the strengths of the evolutionary social sciences, and criticisms of the\
  \ evolutionary social sciences, with a focus on evolutionary psychology. We discuss\
  \ the ties between the study of human demography and the eugenics movement, and\
  \ the recent academic resurgence of eugenics. Finally, we discuss issues with the\
  \ national IQ datasets created by Richard Lynn, and ideas surrounding sex differences\
  \ and representativeness in academia.</p>\n"
