  <p>In this episode, we talk about wellbeing and happiness. We start with some definitions,\
  \ and then get into topics like the factors behind wellbeing, and cross-cultural\
  \ differences in how people think about happiness. We ask if philosophers and religious\
  \ people are happier. We talk about public policies that target wellbeing, focusing\
  \ on New Zealand. We discuss hedonism, and Robert Nozick\u2019s experience machine.\
  \ Finally, we ask if wellbeing can be taught.</p>\n"
