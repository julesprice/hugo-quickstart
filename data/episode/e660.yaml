shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 17th 2022.  \nWilliam Costello finished his MSc in Psychology:\
  \ Culture and Evolution at Brunel University London in 2021. The topic of his thesis\
  \ was incels. Later this year he will join Dr. David Buss's Evolutionary Psychology\
  \ lab at the University of Texas at Austin, as a PhD student. He will retain an\
  \ honorary research assistant role at Swansea University. He writes opinion pieces\
  \ on a range of cultural issues including gender and identity politics, and his\
  \ work has been featured in Quillette and Areo, and his academic research has been\
  \ presented at several academic conferences around the world.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about the psychology of incels, and modern mating. We first define incels,\
  \ and go through their psychological traits. We talk about their mental wellbeing,\
  \ and their self-perceptions of their own mate value. We discuss possible psychotherapeutic\
  \ approaches, and singlehood. We talk about how people should view incels, misrepresentations\
  \ in the media, and the advice they get online. We then get into some issues with\
  \ modern mating, how it is hard for both men and women, and potential solutions.\n\
