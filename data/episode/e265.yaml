shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 26th, 2019.  \nDr. Reinout E. de Vries is Associate\
  \ Professor at the VU University Amsterdam and Full Professor at the University\
  \ of Twente. Together with researchers like Michael Ashton and Kibeom Lee, he has\
  \ worked on the HEXACO model of personality, showing that it provides a more optimal\
  \ description of personality than the Big Five model and showing that it is, through\
  \ its addition of Honesty-Humility, better able to predict a number of counterproductive\
  \ behaviors than the Big Five model. His main research interests are in the areas\
  \ of personality, communication styles, and leadership. Recent work has focused\
  \ on the construction of a six-dimensional Communication Styles Inventory (CSI),\
  \ a Brief HEXACO personality Inventory (BHI), the relation between Impression Management\
  \ and Overclaiming and HEXACO personality, and on the relation between self- and\
  \ other-rated HEXACO personality on the one hand and leadership, proactivity, impression\
  \ management, and overclaiming on the other. He is currently working on lexical\
  \ studies on sport personality and leadership and followership styles.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about personality inventories, with particular focus on the HEXACO\
  \ and its applications. We also talk about communication styles and the CSI, and\
  \ the communication styles and personality traits that work the best in the workplace\
  \ and for leaders.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:16  The Big Five, the HEXACO, and the limitations\
