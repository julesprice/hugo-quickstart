shownotes: "<p>Dr. Reinout E. de Vries is Associate Professor at the VU University\
  \ Amsterdam and Full Professor at the University of Twente. Together with researchers\
  \ like Michael Ashton and Kibeom Lee, he has worked on the HEXACO model of personality,\
  \ showing that it provides a more optimal description of personality than the Big\
  \ Five model and showing that it is, through its addition of Honesty-Humility, better\
  \ able to predict a number of counterproductive behaviors than the Big Five model.\
  \ His main research interests are in the areas of personality, communication styles,\
  \ and leadership. Recent work has focused on the construction of a six-dimensional\
  \ Communication Styles Inventory (CSI), a Brief HEXACO personality Inventory (BHI),\
  \ the relation between Impression Management and Overclaiming and HEXACO personality,\
  \ and on the relation between self- and other-rated HEXACO personality on the one\
  \ hand and leadership, proactivity, impression management, and overclaiming on the\
  \ other. He is currently working on lexical studies on sport personality and leadership\
  \ and followership styles.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about personality inventories,\

summary: Dr. Reinout E. de Vries is Associate Professor at the VU University Amsterdam
  and Full Professor at the University of Twente. Together with researchers like Michael
  Ashton and Kibeom Lee, he has worked on the HEXACO model of personality, showing
  that it provides a more optimal description of personality than the Big Five model
  and showing that it is, through its addition of Honesty-Humility, better able to
  predict a number of counterproductive behaviors than the Big Five model. His main
  research interests are in the areas of personality, communication styles, and leadership.
  Recent work has focused on the construction of a six-dimensional Communication Styles
  Inventory (CSI), a Brief HEXACO personality Inventory (BHI), the relation between
  Impression Management and Overclaiming and HEXACO personality, and on the relation
  between self- and other-rated HEXACO personality on the one hand and leadership,
  proactivity, impression management, and overclaiming on the other. He is currently
  working on lexical studies on sport personality and leadership and followership
  styles.
