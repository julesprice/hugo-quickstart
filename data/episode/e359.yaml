shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 11th, 2020.  \nDr. Guy Madison is Professor at the Department\
  \ of Psychology at University of Ume\xE5, Sweden. Dr. Madison does research in Neuroscience,\
  \ Genetics and Evolutionary Biology. \n\nThis is my second talk with Dr. Guy Madison,\
  \ where we talk about gender studies and the politics of gender. We refer to gender\
  \ studies and the impact they have on academia in general. We get into Swedish politicians\u2019\
  \ arguments for gender quotas, and ask if they really solve any issues, and what\
  \ they are really about (power and influence rather than quality and productivity).\
  \ Finally, we talk about the gender equality paradox, and how to improve the quality\
  \ of gender studies.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:48  Ate gender studies scientific?  \n\

  \ studies  \n1:32:44  Can we make men and women more psychologically equal?  \n\
