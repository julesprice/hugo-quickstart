shownotes: "<p>Dr. Guy Madison is Professor at the Department of Psychology at University\
  \ of Ume\xE5, Sweden. Dr. Madison does research in Neuroscience, Genetics and Evolutionary\
  \ Biology.</p>\n<p>This is my second talk with Dr. Guy Madison, where we talk about\
  \ gender studies and the politics of gender. We refer to gender studies and the\
  \ impact they have on academia in general. We get into Swedish politicians\u2019\
  \ arguments for gender quotas, and ask if they really solve any issues, and what\
  \ they are really about (power and influence rather than quality and productivity).\
  \ Finally, we talk about the gender equality paradox, and how to improve the quality\
  \ of gender studies.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Madison\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty\
