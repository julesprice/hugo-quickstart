shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 6th 2020.  \nDr. Laura Crucianelli currently works as\
  \ a postdoctoral researcher in Henrik Erhsson\u2019s lab at the Karolinska Institute,\
  \ in Stockholm. Dr. Crucianelli completed her PhD at the Department of Psychology,\
  \ University of Hertfordshire, and in collaboration with University College London\
  \ under the supervision of Dr. Paul Jenkinson and Dr. Katerina Fotopoulou.  Her\
  \ PhD project investigated affective touch, sense of body ownership and interoceptive\
  \ awareness in both healthy and clinical populations.\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about interoception, and how it can relate to some psychiatric conditions. We\
  \ go through topics like affective touch, and the sense of body ownership. We talk\
  \ about the Rubber Hand Illusion, and what it tells us about interoception. We also\
  \ touch on minimal self-awareness, and how we can communicate emotions through touch.\
  \ And, finally, we discuss what goes wrong in some clinical populations, focusing\
  \ on anorexia nervosa patients, and how we might be able to improve psychiatric\
  \ practices in the future.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:51  What is interoception?  \n02:09\
