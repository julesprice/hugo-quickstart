shownotes: "<p>Dr. Laura Crucianelli currently works as a postdoctoral researcher\
  \ in Henrik Erhsson\u2019s lab at the Karolinska Institute, in Stockholm. Dr. Crucianelli\
  \ completed her PhD at the Department of Psychology, University of Hertfordshire,\
  \ and in collaboration with University College London under the supervision of Dr.\
  \ Paul Jenkinson and Dr. Katerina Fotopoulou. Her PhD project investigated affective\
  \ touch, sense of body ownership and interoceptive awareness in both healthy and\
  \ clinical populations.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about interoception, and\
  \ how it can relate to some psychiatric conditions. We go through topics like affective\
  \ touch, and the sense of body ownership. We talk about the Rubber Hand Illusion,\
  \ and what it tells us about interoception. We also touch on minimal self-awareness,\
  \ and how we can communicate emotions through touch. And, finally, we discuss what\
  \ goes wrong in some clinical populations, focusing on anorexia nervosa patients,\
  \ and how we might be able to improve psychiatric practices in the future.</p>\n\
