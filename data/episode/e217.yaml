  \ She has published over 90 peer-reviewed journal articles primarily related to\

  \ on the Nature of Women.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about evolutionary psychology\
  \ and feminism. We first refer to determinants of female attractiveness and mate\
  \ preferences; and intrasexual competition strategies, and how some of them may\
  \ backfire. In the second part, we discuss how we can integrate evolutionary theory\
  \ and feminism, and also aspects of women\u2019s evolution and behavior that have\
  \ traditionally been neglected in evolutionary psychology, particularly women\u2019\
  s friendships. We also talk about evolutionary approaches to art, and what women\
  \ like to paint. Toward the end, we discuss the extent to which the State should\
  \ regulate certain activities, like prostitution.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr.\
