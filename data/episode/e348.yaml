shownotes: '<p>Dr. Robyn Bluhm is an Associate Professor with a joint appointment
  in the Department of Philosophy and Lyman Briggs College at Michigan State University.
  Her research examines philosophical issues in neuroscience and in medicine, with
  a particular focus on the relationship between ethical and epistemological questions
  in these areas. She has written extensively on the philosophy of evidence-based
  practice and on the use of functional neuroimaging in psychiatry. She is a co-editor
  of Neurofeminism: Issues at the Intersection of Feminist Theory and Cognitive Science.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on the philosophy of medicine, and the philosophy of
  neuroscience and the neuroscience of gender. We go through some general topics in
  the philosophy of medicine, like evidence-based medicine, if medicine is a science,
  how it is influenced by culture, the limitations of the integration between research
  and practice, the difference between medicine and healthcare, and how philosophy
  can improve healthcare practice. Then we get into neuroscience, and refer to the
  limitations of current imaging techniques, and discuss the neuroscience of gender,
  neurosexism, neurofeminism, and the impact of studying sex differences on society.</p>
