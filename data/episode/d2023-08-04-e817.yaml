  \ we talk about topics in evolutionary anthropology and human behavioral ecology.\
  \ We first talk about male hunting, and what we can learn about human sociality\
  \ by studying it. We discuss if hunting peoples are conservationists. We talk about\
  \ the costs and benefits of monogamy and polygyny for women, and what explains polyandry.\
  \ We discuss human warfare, the debate between the \u201Cdeep-rooters\u201D and\
  \ the \u201Cshallow-rooters\u201D, and Chagnon\u2019s argument that Unokai have\
  \ more wives and children than others. We talk about male androphilia, its universality,\
  \ and what explains it. We discuss the divide between the evolutionary and sociocultural\
  \ subfields within anthropology, and address criticisms of evolutionary anthropology.\
  \ Finally, we talk about the relationship between human behavioral ecology and evolutionary\n\
  psychology.</p>\n"
