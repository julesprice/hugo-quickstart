  Her has interests primarily focused in the foundations of physics, metaphysics,
  and logic. His books include Quantum Non-Locality and Relativity, Truth and Paradox
  and The Metaphysics Within Physics. He is a member of the Academie Internationale

  <p>In this episode, we talk about the philosophy of physics and metaphysics. We
  start by presenting some of the questions asked in philosophy of physics. We then
  discuss quantum mechanics and string theory. We talk about the nature of time, and
  ask if time travel will ever be possible and if it even makes sense theoretically.
  Finally, we address the relationship between Physics and Metaphysics, and we discuss
  if philosophy has been making any progress.</p>
