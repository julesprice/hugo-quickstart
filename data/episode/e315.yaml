shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 17th, 2020.  \nDr. Edward Hagen is Professor of Evolutionary\
  \ Anthropology at Washington State University. His research takes an evolutionary\
  \ approach to non-infectious diseases, with a focus on mental health. He investigates\
  \ tobacco use in the larger context of human use of plant secondary compounds. He\
  \ investigates depression, suicide, and deliberate self-harm as potential signaling\
  \ strategies. Child growth and development is a research theme that grew out of\
  \ his work on postpartum depression. He has also recently begun testing evolutionary\
  \ models of leadership, as part of his more general interest in the evolution of\
  \ human social organization. Finally, he has published a number of theoretical papers\
  \ on evolutionary approaches to ontogeny, cognition, and behavior.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about the application of evolutionary anthropology to a better understanding\
  \ of mental illness. We refer to the importance of the social context of the individual.\
  \ We address Thomas Szasz\u2019s work, and a constructive theory of mental illness.\
  \ We then get into the bargaining model and costly signaling, and how it applies\
  \ to suicide, anger, depression, self-harm, and postpartum depression. We also refer\
  \ to alternative models, like inclusive fitness model. Then, we explore the paradox\
  \ of drug reward in humans, and why we consume plant neurotoxins from adolescence\
  \ onward in all societies, and we talk about the age and sex difference in substance\
  \ use. Finally, Dr. Hagen tells us about current work he\u2019s doing on evolutionary\
  \ models of leadership and sexual selection.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:17  How can anthropology\
