  \ Astrobiology Center at Columbia University. He works in the fields of exoplanetary\
  \ science and astrobiology, and writes extensively about science for a popular audience.\
  \ One ultimate goal of his research is to find planets that could harbor recognizable\
  \ life, and to detect the presence of that life\u2014an effort that falls under\
  \ the banner of astrobiology.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about astrobiology\
  \ and exoplanetary science. We start with a bit of the history behind astrobiology.\
  \ We go through topics like what is a habitable zone; several hypothesis as to how\
  \ life might have originated on Earth; places in our solar system and on exoplanets\
  \ that could harbor life, with focus on Europa, Enceladus, and Mars, and how we\
  \ can detect it. We talk specifically about the recent finding of phosphine on Venus.\
  \ We finish with a discussion on the search for intelligent life.</p>\n"
