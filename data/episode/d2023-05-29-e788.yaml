shownotes: '<p>Dr. Alexander Bor is a postdoc at the CEU Democracy Institute&#39;s
  Research Group on De- and Re-Democratization and a Visiting Professor at CEU Vienna.
  His research focuses on how the human mind navigates social and political challenges
  like political polarization, online political hostility, the COVID-19 pandemic,
  or selecting and evaluating political leaders.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about online political hostility, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
  We start by talking about the sharing of fake news on social media, partisan polarization,
  and the psychology of online political hostility. We then get into the COVID-19
  pandemic, and go through topics like motivating the public with health advice; compliance
  with fear; communicating hope; individual factors that predicted acceptance of the
  vaccines; how governments should have communicated about the vaccines; how the pandemic
  got moralized; prejudice against the unvaccinated; and broader social and political
  effects on institutions and social solidarity.</p>
