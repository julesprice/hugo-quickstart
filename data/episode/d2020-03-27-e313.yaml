shownotes: "<p>Dr. Robert Kelly is Professor of Archaeology at the University of Wyoming.\
  \ Dr. Kelly has shaped and contributed much to our understanding of hunter-gatherer\
  \ societies. He has a deep interest in Western North American archaeology, especially\
  \ in the Great Basin area. Current understanding of hunter-gatherer mobility and\
  \ foraging patterns are also influenced strongly by his research, fieldwork, and\
  \ ethnology. By examining the Pleistocene colonization of the Americas by examining\
  \ artifacts and lithic technology, Dr. Kelly reconstructs past life-ways and compares\
  \ them to current foraging societies, and examines human adaptation to climate change\
  \ during different periods in the past. He\u2019s the author of books like The Foraging\
  \ Spectrum: Diversity in Hunter-Gatherer Lifeways, and The Fifth Beginning: What\
  \ Six Million Years of Human History Can Tell Us about Our Future.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we focus for the most part on Dr. Kelly\u2019s book, The Fifth Beginning.\
  \ But first we discuss the discipline of Archaeology in its strengths and limitations.\
  \ Then, we get into the meat of the book, and talk about the first four beginnings:\
  \ the beginning of technology; the beginning of culture; the beginning of agriculture;\
  \ the beginning of the State; and the fifth beginning, which we are going through\
  \ now, starting around 1500 CE. We also tackle how we might get to solve current\
  \ urgent global-scale problems, like climate change. As a final topic, we explore\
  \ issues surrounding hunter-gatherers, how we think about them as a monolithic social\
  \ entity, and we also refer to thinks like variability, human universals, and evolutionary\
  \ psychology and \u201Chuman nature\u201D.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Kelly\u2019\
