shownotes: "<p>Dr. Vibeke Ottesen is a Norwegian criminologist with an interest in\
  \ how nature and nurture combined create human behavior. She has a popular science\
  \ blog \u2013 Biosocial - where she comments on news, scientific findings and literature\
  \ relevant to her subject \u2013 more often than not with an evolutionary informed\
  \ approach to understanding the subject matter.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk\
  \ about criminal behavior from an evolutionary perspective. We first get into some\
  \ of the basics of evolutionary theory that help explain criminal behavior. We talk\
  \ about cross-cultural evidence about criminal behavior, and more specifically homicide,\
  \ and also about some of the complications that arise from differences in how countries\
  \ collect data. We discuss the importance of distinguishing between different categories\
  \ of homicide. We talk a lot about the Scandinavian countries during the interview,\
  \ particularly how gender equality might influence rates of intimate partner violence\
  \ and homicide, and the gender equality paradox. We explore sex differences in criminal\
  \ behavior. We discuss filicide and neonaticide, and why there are differences between\
  \ biological parents and stepparents. We also tackle suicidal behavior. Finally,\
  \ we discuss ways of preventing homicide, and also why it is so hard to communicate\
  \ evolutionarily-informed science to the general public.</p>\n"
