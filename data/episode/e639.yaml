shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 1st 2022.  \nDr. Leo Tiokhin is Research Fellow at\
  \ the Institute for Advanced Study at the University of Amsterdam, an Interdisciplinary\
  \ Research Specialist at Strategic Alliance: TU/e, WUR, UU & UMC Utrecht, and a\
  \ postdoctoral researcher at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Dr. Tiokhin\
  \ is a meta-scientist who studies the forces that shape how scientists do their\
  \ work and make inferences from the populations that they study. Much of his research\
  \ focuses on how incentive structures affect scientific efficiency and reliability,\
  \ and how we can improve the recognition and reward structures in science. \n\n\
  In this episode, we talk about the institution of science and the production of\
  \ scientific knowledge, with a focus on the social sciences. We start by talking\
  \ about the study of science as a social phenomenon, incentives structures in science,\
  \ scientific efficiency and scientific reliability, deception and honesty in academic\
  \ publishing, and replications. We get specifically into the social sciences, and\
  \ discuss evolutionary approaches, problems with cross-cultural research, and testing\
  \ hypotheses. Finally, we talk about scientific models and how they relate to reality,\
  \ and if potential reforms to science should apply to it generally or to specific\
  \ fields.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:59  Studying science as a social phenomenon\
