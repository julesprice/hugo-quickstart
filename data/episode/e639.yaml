shownotes: '<p>Dr. Leonid Tiokhin is Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced
  Study at the University of Amsterdam, and a postdoctoral researcher at the Eindhoven
  University of Technology. Dr. Tiokhin is a meta-scientist who studies the forces
  that shape how scientists do their work and make inferences from the populations
  that they study. Much of his research focuses on how incentive structures affect
  scientific efficiency and reliability, and how we can improve the recognition and
  reward structures in science.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about the institution of science and the production
  of scientific knowledge, with a focus on the social sciences. We start by talking
  about the study of science as a social phenomenon, incentives structures in science,
  scientific efficiency and scientific reliability, deception and honesty in academic
  publishing, and replications. We get specifically into the social sciences, and
  discuss evolutionary approaches, problems with cross-cultural research, and testing
  hypotheses. Finally, we talk about scientific models and how they relate to reality,
  and if potential reforms to science should apply to it generally or to specific
  fields.</p>
