  \ from the California Institute of Technology in 1987, and a Ph.D. in Physics from\
  \ The University of Texas at Austin in 1993. He is External Professor at the Santa\

  \ at the Earth-Life Science Institute, Tokyo Institute of Technology. He is a physicist\
  \ specializing in the origin of life, non-equilibrium systems, economics, and the\
  \ evolution of human languages.</p>\n<p>Here, we go through the main content of\
  \ his 2016 book, The Origin and Nature of Life on Earth; the history of the RNA-first\
  \ world, and the metabolism-first world; the continuity between geochemistry and\
  \ biochemistry; the biosphere as the 4th geosphere; the role of hydrothermal vents\
  \ in the rise of biochemistry; the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle); a new analysis\
  \ suggesting relations between the rise of macromolecules (particularly the RNA\
  \ and proteins in the ribosome) and the elaboration and fixing of more complex metabolic\
  \ pathways; and the need (or not) for extraplanetary sources of chemicals.</p>\n\
