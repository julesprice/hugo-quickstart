shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 20th 2021.  \nDr. Peter Ditto is Professor of Psychological\
  \ Science at UC Irvine School of Social Ecology. He is interested in \u201Chot cognition\u201D\
  \ \u2014 the interface between passion and reason. His research examines the role\
  \ of motivation, emotion and intuition in social, political, moral, medical, and\
  \ legal judgment. Most generally, he has sought to explain the phenomenon of \u201C\
  motivated reasoning\u201D \u2014 how the desire to reach a particular conclusion\
  \ biases the processing of information related to that conclusion. His early work\
  \ examined the role such biases play in responses to threatening medical information\
  \ (e.g., denial). More recently, his work has focused on motivated moral reasoning,\
  \ particularly how people selectively recruit general principles and factual beliefs\
  \ to support desired moral conclusions. Another key focus of his current research\
  \ is partisan political bias. This work examines the multiple ways that political\
  \ ideology biases our political judgments and behavior. Finally, he is interested\
  \ in a variety of psychological issues involved in end-of-life medical decision\
  \ making.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about motivated reasoning, morality, and politics.\
  \ We start with motivated reasoning, what it is, and the domains where it applies.\
  \ We apply it to medical decision-making. We discuss how moral reasoning works,\
  \ moral intuitions, moral foundations, and the connection between morality and politics.\
  \ We talk about political bias and science denial on the left and the right. We\
  \ discuss the special case of libertarians. Finally, we talk about how we should\
  \ think about the relation between personality and politics, and personality and\
  \ morality, and Dr. Ditto gives an evolutionary rationale for motivated reasoning\
  \ and political behavior.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:43  What is motivated\
