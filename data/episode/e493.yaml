shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 3rd 2021.  \nDr. Tim Clutton-Brock is Professor in the\
  \ Department of Zoology at Cambridge University. He is known for his comparative\
  \ studies of the behavioral ecology of mammals, particularly red deer and meerkats.\
  \ He currently works in three main areas: The evolution of vertebrate breeding systems;\
  \ Population regulation and the control of population stability in large mammals;\
  \ Natural and sexual selection in natural populations.\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about mammal societies. First, we discuss when societies started in evolution,\
  \ and how to understand sociality from an evolutionary perspective. We refer to\
  \ the costs and benefits of being a social species. We talk about group selection.\
  \ We explore different aspects of mammal sociality, including mating and reproduction,\
  \ cooperative breeding, philopatry, social organization, and sexual division of\
  \ labor. We also talk about variation in population density, and how it affects\
  \ natural and sexual selection. Finally, we discuss what is distinctive about primate\
  \ and human societies. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:45  When did societies\
