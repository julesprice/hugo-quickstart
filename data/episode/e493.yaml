shownotes: '<p>Dr. Tim Clutton-Brock is Professor in the Department of Zoology at
  Cambridge University. He is known for his comparative studies of the behavioral
  ecology of mammals, particularly red deer and meerkats. He currently works in three
  main areas: The evolution of vertebrate breeding systems; Population regulation
  and the control of population stability in large mammals; Natural and sexual selection
  in natural populations.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about mammal societies. First, we discuss when societies
  started in evolution, and how to understand sociality from an evolutionary perspective.
  We refer to the costs and benefits of being a social species. We talk about group
  selection. We explore different aspects of mammal sociality, including mating and
  reproduction, cooperative breeding, philopatry, social organization, and sexual
  division of labor. We also talk about variation in population density, and how it
  affects natural and sexual selection. Finally, we discuss what is distinctive about
  primate and human societies.</p>
