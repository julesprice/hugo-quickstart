shownotes: '<p>Dr. David Pietraszewski is Research Scientist at the Max Planck Institute
  for Human Development. He is an experimental psychologist who applies evolutionary
  theorizing to Social, Cognitive, and Developmental questions. He is particularly
  interested in characterizing the psychology of multi-agent conflict and cooperation
  ("coalitional psychology").</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about modularity of mind and coalitional psychology.
  In terms of modularity of mind, we cover topics like: Fodorian modularity, modularity
  in evolutionary psychology, and different levels of analysis when thinking about
  modularity. In terms of coalitional psychology, we talk about what it is from an
  evolutionary perspective, social categorization and the categories people pay attention
  to, race, the relationship between coalitional psychology and politics, and hierarchy
  and leadership in human societies.</p>
