shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 14th 2021.  \nDr. Elly Vintiadis is a philosopher of\
  \ mind and psychiatry at Deree, the American College of Greece. Her work focuses\
  \ on the mind, its products and disorders, and the nature of their dependence on\
  \ the social environment. She is mainly interested in what mental disorders can\
  \ tell us about the nature of the mind, and in emergence and explanation, but her\
  \ research also extends to epistemology, metaphilosophy and animal ethics. She is\
  \ the author of three books, including Philosophy by Women: 22 Philosophers reflect\
  \ on Philosophy and Its Value.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Philosophy by Women.\
  \ We first cover some general topics on philosophy, like what the discipline is\
  \ really about, the role that emotions and personal experience play in it, and the\
  \ relationship between philosophy and science. We then talk about philosophy and\
  \ politics, the impact of philosophy in society, and the ways the general public\
  \ than profit from learning more about philosophy. Finally, we discuss the position\
  \ of women in philosophy, discrimination against women, and how philosophy can empower\
  \ them.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:32  What is philosophy, and how it\u2019\
