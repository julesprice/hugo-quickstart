  \ Moral Fool. We start by talk about morality as a tool, and the uses and abuses\
  \ of morality. We discuss the concept of the \u201Cmoral fool\u201D, and what amorality\
  \ is. We talk about moral responsibility, and the moral character of systems of\
  \ law. We discuss moral relativism and moral nihilism. We talk about the case of\
  \ religion, and ask if it is especially problematic. We discuss if there is ever\
  \ any moral progress. We discuss the role moral philosophers play in society, if\
  \ any. Finally, we also talk about the relationship between science and ethics,\
  \ and if something could replace ethics.</p>\n"
