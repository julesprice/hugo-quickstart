shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 6th 2021.  \nDr Hans-Georg Moeller is a professor\
  \ in the Philosophy and Religious Studies Programme at the University of Macau.\
  \ His research focuses on Chinese and Comparative Philosophy (specifically Daoism)\
  \ and on Social and Political Thought (specifically Social Systems Theory). He is\
  \ the author of several books, including The Moral Fool: A Case for Amorality.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on The Moral Fool. We start by talk about morality as\
  \ a tool, and the uses and abuses of morality. We discuss the concept of the \u201C\
  moral fool\u201D, and what amorality is. We talk about moral responsibility, and\
  \ the moral character of systems of law. We discuss moral relativism and moral nihilism.\
  \ We talk about the case of religion, and ask if it is especially problematic. We\
  \ discuss if there is ever any moral progress. We discuss the role moral philosophers\
  \ play in society, if any. Finally, we also talk about the relationship between\
  \ science and ethics, and if something could replace ethics.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
