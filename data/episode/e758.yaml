  <p>In this episode, we focus on Articulating a Thought. We start by talking about
  self-knowledge, how people acquire it, and how it is approached philosophically.
  We then get into articulation, and the reasoning behind articulating a thought.
  We also discuss why some thoughts are easy to articulate, while others are very
  hard, the limits of language, and clarity of thought.</p>
