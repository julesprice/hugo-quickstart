shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 4th, 2019.  \nDr. Douglas P. Fry is Professor and\
  \ Chair in the Department of Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of North\
  \ Carolina at Greensboro. He has written extensively on aggression, conflict, and\
  \ conflict resolution in his own books and in journals such as Science and American\
  \ Anthropologist. His work frequently engages the debate surrounding the origins\
  \ of war, arguing against claims that war or lethal aggression is rooted in human\
  \ evolution. He\u2019s the author or editor of books like The Human Potential for\
  \ Peace; Beyond War; War, Peace, and Human Nature; and Nurturing Our Humanity.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on the anthropology of war. Dr. Fry critiques the evolutionary\
  \ psychology approach to war. We go through some of the flaws with the archaeological\
  \ evidence presented by Steven Pinker in The Better Angels of Our Nature. We then\
  \ get into the ecological and social conditions that favor war, and critiques about\
  \ the data Napoleon Chagnon collected on the Yanomam\xF6. We also talk about violence-defusing\
  \ mechanisms in mammals. We end the interview talking about ways of preventing war\
  \ in modern societies.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:03  What evolutionary psychologists\
