shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 24th 2020.  \nDr. Niels Dingemanse is Tenured Professor\
  \ in Behavioural Ecology in the Department of Biology at the Ludwig Maximilians\
  \ University, Germany. He conducts evolutionary behavioral ecology research, asking\
  \ questions about the adaptive evolution of behavioral strategies, and their genetic\
  \ architectures, within an ecological context. His research is motivated by behavioral\
  \ ecology, life-history, and quantitative genetics theory, and seeks to test predictions\
  \ and assumptions of adaptive theory using observational and experimental approaches\
  \ in the laboratory and the wild.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on animal personality.\
  \ We discuss the relationship between ecology and evolutionary biology, the evolution\
  \ of behavioral traits, and behavioral plasticity. We then get into personality,\
  \ and go through its behavioral genetics, social roles, and ecological aspects individuals\
  \ respond to.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:59  The relationship between ecology and evolutionary\
