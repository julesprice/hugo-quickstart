shownotes: "<p>Dr. Robert Barton is Professor in the Department of Anthropology, Member\
  \ of the Durham Cultural Evolution Research Centre at Durham University, UK. He\
  \ is an evolutionary biologist/anthropologist interested in brains, behavior and\
  \ cognition, using phylogenetic comparative methods to study how these traits evolved.\
  \ He developed and tested the 'Visual brain hypothesis' for primate brain size evolution.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about the evolution of the primate brain. We talk about\
  \ the relationship between the brain, cognition, and behavior. We discuss ecological\
  \ and social factors behind the evolution of the primate brain. We talk specifically\
  \ about sexual selection, social selection, life history, and maternal investment.\
  \ We talk about the evolution of the cerebellum and its functions. We explain why\
  \ cognition cannot be disembodied. We talk about the \u201Cvisual brain hypothesis\u201D\
  . We discuss the growth of the primate brain, and specifically the hominin brain,\
  \ and ask if there is anything unique about the human brain. Finally, we talk about\
  \ the evolution of the color red, and what it signals.</p>\n"
