  <p>In this episode, we talk about how memory develops in children and how it works.\
  \ We start with some basics about memory development. We Talk about how we rewrite\
  \ our memories every time we recall them, and memory sharing and memory-sharing\
  \ styles. We discuss the existence of repressed memories, and how false memories\
  \ can be engendered. We introduce a bit of an evolutionary perspective, to try to\
  \ understand why our memories fail in these domains. We also talk about autobiographical\
  \ memory and its relation with the \u201Cself\u201D. Finally, we discuss some of\
  \ the problems with eyewitness testimonies.</p>\n"
