  \ Her research interests and record cut across the psychological domains of forensics,\

  \ we expand on the first interview I\u2019ve had with Dr. Todd Shackelford (<a href=\"\
  https://youtu.be/-sFFlebGP70\">https://youtu.be/-sFFlebGP70</a>), and talk about\
  \ things related to human romantic relationships and parent-offspring conflict.\
  \ First, we discuss the importance of parental investment theory in understanding\
  \ where conflict in romantic relationships stems from, and the role that fathers\
  \ play in raising children. We also try to conceive how this knowledge could translate\
  \ into social policy, when it comes to child support and other kinds of social issues.\
  \ Then, we talk about domestic violence as a set of evolved mate guarding tactics,\
  \ and violence exerted on children on the part of genetic parents and stepparents.\
  \ And, finally, before talking about the specific case of filicide-suicide, we go\
  \ off on a tangent to talk about evolutionary mismatch and some ways by which modern\
  \ environments might affect us, including technology like social media.&nbsp;</p>\n\
