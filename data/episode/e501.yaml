  \ the ways in which everyday consumer decision-making affects political attitudes\
  \ and behavior.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Consumer Citizen. We discuss\
  \ how consumer behavior influences political behavior, how people think about politics,\
  \ and the phenomenon of conspicuous consumption. We cover some of the concepts presented\
  \ in the book, like alignability, consumer fairness, operational transparency, and\
  \ taxpayer receipts. And we talk about to what extent do people\u2019s behaving\
  \ as consumers help them make wiser political decisions.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
