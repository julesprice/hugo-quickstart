  <p>In this episode, we focus on Understanding Sexual Serial Killing. We start by
  defining sexual serial killing, and get into what motivates it. We talk about the
  psychological traits, the social context, and sociohistorical context of sexual
  serial killing. We discuss the best model to explain it, biological factors, working
  models and scripts during child development, what triggers sexual arousal, paraphilias,
  and addiction. We also discuss if there is a copycat effect in this type of crime.</p>
