  <p>In this episode, we talk about virtual environments, online politics, populism,
  and Big Data in the social sciences. We start by discussing if social interaction
  changes in virtual environments. We talk about selective exposure to online political
  content, and if that affects political behavior. We get into populism: is it a thin
  ideology? Is it on the rise? Finally, we discuss if Big Data is useful for the social
  sciences.</p>
