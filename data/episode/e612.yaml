  \ about virtual environments, online politics, populism, and Big Data in the social\
  \ sciences. We start by discussing if social interaction changes in virtual environments.\
  \ We talk about selective exposure to online political content, and if that affects\
  \ political behavior. We get into populism: is it a thin ideology? Is it on the\
  \ rise? Finally, we discuss if Big Data is useful for the social sciences.\n\nTime\
