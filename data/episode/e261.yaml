shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 16th, 2019.  \nDr. Noam Chomsky is an American linguist,\
  \ philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, political activist, and social critic.\
  \ Sometimes called \"the father of modern linguistics\", Dr. Chomsky is also a major\
  \ figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive\
  \ science. He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts\
  \ Institute of Technology (MIT) and laureate professor at the University of Arizona,\
  \ and is the author of over 100 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics,\
  \ and mass media.\n\nIn this episode, we go through some of the major highlights\
  \ in Dr. Chomsky\u2019s intellectual career. We talk about the importance of the\
  \ cognitive revolution in the 50s/60s, and how behaviorism was dominating back then.\
  \ We refer to what came to be known as the Chomsky-Piaget debate in 1975, and also\
  \ address the issue of the modularity of mind. We also discuss evolutionary psychology.\
  \ Finally, we refer to some of the main points addressed in the debate between Dr.\
  \ Chomsky and Michel Foucault in 1971, namely human nature from an epistemological\
  \ perspective and the importance of creativity.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:37  The importance\
