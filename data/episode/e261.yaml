  <p>In this episode, we go through some of the major highlights in Dr. Chomsky\u2019\
  s intellectual career. We talk about the importance of the cognitive revolution\
  \ in the 50s/60s, and how behaviorism was dominating back then. We refer to what\
  \ came to be known as the Chomsky-Piaget debate in 1975, and also address the issue\
  \ of the modularity of mind. We also discuss evolutionary psychology. Finally, we\
  \ refer to some of the main points addressed in the debate between Dr. Chomsky and\
  \ Michel Foucault in 1971, namely human nature from an epistemological perspective\
  \ and the importance of creativity.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Chomsky\u2019\
