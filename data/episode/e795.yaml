shownotes: "Dr. Owen Flanagan is James B. Duke Distinguished Professor Emeritus of\
  \ Philosophy at Duke University. His work is in philosophy of mind and psychiatry,\
  \ ethics, moral psychology, and cross-cultural philosophy. He is the author of The\
  \ Geography of Morals: Varieties of Moral Possibility.\n\nIn this episode, we focus\
  \ on The Geography of Morals. We talk about what it means to do ethics in a more\
  \ culturally attuned way, and going beyond WEIRD societies. We discuss minority\
  \ cultures, and some of the challenges with living in multicultural societies. We\
  \ touch on honor cultures, and individual differences. We discuss if philosophers\
  \ can really identify what is good or right independently of history or culture,\
  \ and how moral philosophers are influenced by their own culture. We talk about\
  \ political morality and interpersonal morality. We discuss where our moral values\
  \ come from, and delve into moral foundations theory. We discuss if it makes sense\
  \ to talk about inherently good and inherently bad emotions, and focus on the case\
  \ of anger. We talk about the possibility of sociomoral change inside particular\
  \ traditions. We discuss if thought experiments in moral philosophy are ecologically\
  \ valid, and what motivates people to produce moral arguments. Finally, we discuss\
  \ criticisms put forth by postmodernists against the hegemony of Western philosophy.\n\
