  of Philosophy at Duke University. He is the author of The Geography of Morals: Varieties
  of Moral Possibility.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on The Geography of Morals. We talk about what it means
  to do ethics in a more culturally attuned way. We discuss some of the challenges
  of living in multicultural societies. We discuss if philosophers can really identify
  what is good or right independently of history or culture, and how moral philosophers
  are influenced by their own culture. We talk about political morality and interpersonal
  morality. We discuss where our moral values come from, and delve into moral foundations
  theory. We discuss if it makes sense to talk about inherently good and inherently
  bad emotions, and focus on the case of anger. We talk about the possibility of sociomoral
  change inside particular traditions. We discuss if thought experiments in moral
  philosophy are ecologically valid, and what motivates people to produce moral arguments.
  Finally, we discuss criticisms put forth by postmodernists against the hegemony
  of Western philosophy.</p>
