shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 25th 2020.  \nDr. John Hoffecker is Fellow of the\
  \ Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR). He specializes in archaeology\
  \ and human paleoecology. His primary research focus is the global dispersal of\
  \ anatomically modern humans, which began more than 50,000 years ago in Africa.\
  \ He is the author of several books, including Modern Humans: Their African Origin\
  \ and Global Dispersal (2017).\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Dr. Hoffecker\u2019\
  s book. We cover some of the major topics of the book, including: the importance\
  \ of the human hand and the vocal tract in our evolution, and particularly for the\
  \ development of culture; what are modern humans; Out of Africa migrations for both\
  \ species before and after H. sapiens; the technology H. sapiens needed for the\
  \ migrations to be possible; the evolution and interaction with Neanderthals and\
  \ Denisovans; the origins of H. sapiens; the reasons behind the migrations; the\
  \ extinction of megafauna; and human geographic races.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:41 \
