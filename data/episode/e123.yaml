shownotes: "Dr. David Sloan Wilson is SUNY Distinguished Professor of Biology and\
  \ Anthropology at Binghamton University. He applies evolutionary theory to all aspects\
  \ of humanity in addition to the rest of life, both in his own research and as director\
  \ of the Evolution Institute, a unique campus-wide evolutionary studies program\
  \ that recently received NSF funding to expand into a nationwide consortium. His\
  \ books include Darwin\u2019s Cathedral: Evolution, Religion, and the Nature of\
  \ Society; Evolution for Everyone: How Darwin\u2019s Theory Can Change the Way We\
  \ Think About Our Lives; The Neighborhood Project: Using Evolution to Improve My\
  \ City, One Block at a Time and Does Altruism Exist? Culture, Genes, and the Welfare\
  \ of Others; and a recently edited book, Evolution and Contextual Behavioral Science.\n\
  \nIn this episode, our conversation we focused initially on Evolutionary and Contextual\
  \ Behavioral Science, the recently published book edited by Dr. David Sloan Wilson\
  \ and Dr. Steven C. Hayes. We discuss what evolutionary theory brings to the table,\
  \ and its shortcomings in dealing with behavior (human and non-human), and the contributions\
  \ of Skinner, behaviorism and contextual science that have been mostly ignored by\
  \ mainstream Psychology. We then talk about the extended evolutionary synthesis,\
  \ and how Lamarckism might still have a saying in how evolution by natural selection\
  \ works. Finally, we briefly talk about religion as a human construct, and what\
  \ the New Atheists get wrong about it; and about group selection included in a multilevel\
  \ selection process.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:05  Evolutionary and Contextual Behavioral\
