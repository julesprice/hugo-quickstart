  \ Professor at the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Texas Health Science\
  \ Center at San Antonio. He has published extensively on the treatment of PTSD in\

  \ roots of political partisanship, and the interplay between religious practice\
  \ and psychopathology. He\u2019s also the author of Alpha God: The Psychology of\
  \ Religious Violence and Oppression, and Sex, Power, and Partisanship: How Evolutionary\
  \ Science Makes Sense of Our Political Divide.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus\
  \ our conversation on Dr. Garcia\u2019s latest book, \u201CSex, Power, and Partisanship\u201D\
  . We talk about how the liberal and conservative political tribes evolved from the\
  \ standard masculine and feminine psychologies. We discuss how traits that might\
  \ have served an evolutionary function in the past are not necessarily good for\
  \ us in our modern environments, the phenomenon of instinct blindness, and the naturalistic\
  \ fallacy. We refer to the fact that most human societies have been patriarchal\
  \ and how the systems of rule and law favored men, and allowed for them to control\
  \ women\u2019s behavior, with focus on their sexual behavior. Finally, we talk about\
  \ our current polarized political environment, and how we can apply this knowledge\
  \ to counter it, and also what could be the best ways to deal with gender equality\
  \ in politics.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Garcia\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Website:\
