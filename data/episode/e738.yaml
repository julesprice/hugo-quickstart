shownotes: '<p>Dr. Antoine Marie is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of
  Political Science at Aarhus University, Denmark. He conducts cross-cultural psychology
  experiments and develops evolutionary theory to better understand, and if possible,
  mitigate, the cognitive biases that arise from people having strong moral convictions
  on controversial topics, typically in contexts of perceived intergroup conflict.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we first discuss morality from an evolutionary perspective,
  including its social functions. We talk about why people develop strong moral convictions.
  We discuss if morality translates directly into political attitudes, and the link
  between dogmaticism and inter-group conflict. We then get into the cognitive foundations
  of misinformation, and what makes people susceptible to misinformation in the domain
  of science. Finally, we discuss the psychology of conspiracy theories, and address
  the potential solution of moralizing the values of evidence-based and logical thinking.</p>
