  <p>In this episode, we first talk about dual-process theory, reasoning and rationality,\
  \ motivated reasoning, the Dunning-Kruger effect, and the analytic cognitive style\
  \ and ability. We then go through what characterizes pseudo-profound bullshit in\
  \ terms of discourse, the language of climate change deniers, and fake news and\
  \ misinformation (particularly on the internet).</p>\n"
