shownotes: "Dr. Carrie Mongle is Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology\
  \ at Stony Brook University and the Turkana Basin Institute. She also heads the\
  \ Mongle Lab. Her research aims to reconstruct the major trends and transitions\
  \ that characterize hominin diversity and evolution. Her ongoing work towards that\
  \ goal involves (1) the discovery and description of new hominin fossils from the\
  \ Turkana Basin in Kenya; (2) quantification of morphological variation; and (3)\
  \ comprehensive phylogenetic analyses founded on the careful character assessment\
  \ of both craniodental and postcranial characters. In addition, Dr. Mongle is interested\
  \ in evaluating the relationship between variation, evolvability, and macroevolution\
  \ in the primate dentition.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about hominin phylogenetics.\
  \ We first talk about work done in the Turkana Basin in Kenya. We talk about craniodental\
  \ and postcranial features looked at when studying human phylogenetics, and changes\
  \ in hominin dentition. We discuss what we know about hominin phylogeny, and the\
  \ cases of Ardipithecus ramidus and Australopithecus sediba. We talk about studying\
  \ microevolution and macroevolution, and how they interact. We talk about the example\
  \ of primate molars. We discuss the relationship between development and evolution.\
  \ We talk about how we can best model hominin evolution. Finally, we discuss some\
  \ unanswered questions in human phylogenetics.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n\
