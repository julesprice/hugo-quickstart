  \ and How Culture Makes Us Human: Primate Social Evolution and the Formation of\
  \ Human Societies.\n\nIn this episode, we discuss the evolutionary bases of human\
  \ sociality. We talk about how sociality evolved from Old World monkeys to chimpanzees\
  \ and to humans. We refer to the role of biological kin selection, and the biological\
  \ traits that provided a basis for the cultural evolution of kin systems. We discuss\
  \ the social function of kin systems, their limits, and group identities beyond\
  \ kin.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:51  The evolutionary bases of human sociality, and comparisons\
