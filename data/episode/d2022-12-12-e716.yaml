  \ the Stone Age to Today\u2019s Culture Wars.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus\
  \ on Ideological Fixation. We start by addressing the premise of the book, and the\
  \ current relevance of understanding ideology. We talk about ideology and its psychological\
  \ foundations. We discuss what truth is, and the postmodernist challenge. We talk\
  \ about the conflict between religion and science, and go through ideologies like\
  \ liberalism, socialism, and fascism. We also discuss the ideological conflict between\
  \ the \u201CWest\u201D and the \u201CRest\u201D, the biggest debates in contemporary\
  \ liberal democracies, and the \u201Cculture wars\u201D. We talk about intellectuals\
  \ as the source of most ideologies. Finally, we discuss if having an ideology is\
  \ something bad, how to best understand how ideologies develop, and if there are\
  \ solutions for the current ideological conflicts.</p>\n"
