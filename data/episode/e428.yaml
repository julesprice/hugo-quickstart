  \ of free speech. We talk about John Stuart Mill\u2019s position, and the history\
  \ of the political struggle for free speech. We discuss freedom of speech in the\
  \ context of academia and the media. We ask if it makes sense to distinguish speech\
  \ from action, and also address the distinction between freedom of speech and freedom\
  \ of inquiry. Toward the end, Dr. Fish explains why he thinks \u201Cphilosophy does\
  \ not matter\u201D.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:45  Dr. Fish\u2019s background,\
