  <p>In this episode, we focus on free speech. Dr. Fish presents his thesis against\
  \ the idea that free speech exists, and we discuss its details. We start with a\
  \ bit of Dr. Fish\u2019s background and where his interest in free speech comes\
  \ from, and also a definition of free speech. We talk about John Stuart Mill\u2019\
  s position, and the history of the political struggle for free speech. We discuss\
  \ freedom of speech in the context of academia and the media. We ask if it makes\
  \ sense to distinguish speech from action, and also address the distinction between\
  \ freedom of speech and freedom of inquiry. Toward the end, Dr. Fish explains why\
  \ he thinks \u201Cphilosophy does not matter\u201D.</p>\n"
