shownotes: '<p>Dr. Zoe Liberman is Associate Professor of Psychology at the University
  of California Santa Barbara. Dr. Liberman investigates the origins and development
  of human social cognition. She is particularly interested in how infants begin to
  understand our complicated social world, as well as how this understanding changes
  across development and is shaped by experience.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about infant social cognition. We start by discussing
  if there is any particular period in development when children start getting socialized.
  We talk about how children learn about particular individuals, and how they know
  who knows what. We discuss social categorization, and how children learn to distinguish
  between ingroups and outgroups. We talk about how children decide who is friends
  with them and who is not, and cues like resource sharing, similarity, loyalty, and
  secret sharing. We also discuss how children determine when a piece gossip might
  be biased, and when participating in rituals becomes relevant in child development.</p>
