shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 17th 2022.  \nDr. Zoe Liberman is Associate Professor\
  \ of Psychology at the University of California Santa Barbara. Dr. Liberman investigates\
  \ the origins and development of human social cognition. She is particularly interested\
  \ in how infants begin to understand our complicated social world, as well as how\
  \ this understanding changes across development and is shaped by experience. Her\
  \ research focuses on early social categorization. Dr. Liberman is also interested\
  \ in the malleability of early social categorization, including the effects of growing\
  \ up in a multilingual (or otherwise diverse) environment. \n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about infant social cognition. We start by discussing if there is any\
  \ particular period in development when children start getting socialized. We talk\
  \ about how children learn about particular individuals, and how they know who knows\
  \ what. We discuss social categorization, and how children learn to distinguish\
  \ between ingroups and outgroups. We talk about how children decide who is friends\
  \ with them and who is not, and cues like resource sharing, similarity, loyalty,\
  \ and secret sharing. We also discuss how children determine when a piece gossip\
  \ might be biased, and when participating in rituals becomes relevant in child development.\n\
