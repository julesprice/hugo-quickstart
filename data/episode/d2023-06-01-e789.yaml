shownotes: "<p>Dr. Kieran Setiya is Professor of Philosophy at MIT. He works mainly\
  \ in ethics, epistemology, and the philosophy of mind. He is the author of Practical\
  \ Knowledge, Reasons without Rationalism, Knowing Right From Wrong, and, more recently,\
  \ Life Is Hard: How Philosophy Can Help Us Find Our Way.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we focus on Life Is Hard. We start by discussing the purpose of philosophy. We\
  \ talk about what makes life hard, and we discuss if we should avoid hardship; complaining\
  \ about hardship, and pitying other people; and what a life well lived is. We get\
  \ into topics like physical disability and pain; loneliness; friendship; loss and\
  \ grief; Stoicism; being a \u201Cfailure\u201D, and what \u201Csuccess\u201D means;\
  \ injustice; and the meaning of life. Finally, we discuss if argumentation can change\
  \ people\u2019s views on life.</p>\n"
