shownotes: "<p>Dr. Gregory Forth received his doctorate at Oxford and was a professor\
  \ of anthropology at the University of Alberta for more than three decades. He is\
  \ a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and is the author of more than one hundred\
  \ scholarly papers and several academic books. His latest book is Between Ape and\
  \ Human: An Anthropologist on the Trail of a Hidden Hominoid.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we focus on Between Ape and Human. We first talk about Homo floresiensis: its\
  \ discovery, its traits, and its relation to other hominins. We then get into the\
  \ ethnographic work Dr. Forth did with peoples from the island of Flores. We go\
  \ into more detail about the Lio people and their myth of the \u201Cape-man\u201D\
  . We discuss if the \u201Cape-man\u201D could be H. floresiensis. We talk about\
  \ the extent to which anthropologists can rely on people\u2019s claims. Finally,\
  \ we discuss how humans relate to (and think about) \u201Cnot-quite-human\u201D\
  \ animals.</p>\n"
