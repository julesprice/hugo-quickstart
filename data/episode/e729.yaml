shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 29th 2022.  \nDr. Gregory Forth received his doctorate\
  \ at Oxford and was a professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta for\
  \ more than three decades. He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and is\
  \ the author of more than one hundred scholarly papers and several academic books.\
  \ His latest book is Between Ape and Human: An Anthropologist on the Trail of a\
  \ Hidden Hominoid.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Between Ape and Human. We first\
  \ talk about Homo floresiensis: its discovery, its traits, and its relation to other\
  \ hominins. We then get into the ethnographic work Dr. Forth did with peoples from\
  \ the island of Flores. We go into more detail about the Lio people and their myth\
  \ of the \u201Cape-man\u201D. We discuss if the \u201Cape-man\u201D could be H.\
  \ floresiensis. We talk about the extent to which anthropologists can rely on people\u2019\
  s claims. Finally, we discuss how humans relate to (and think about) \u201Cnot-quite-human\u201D\
  \ animals.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:33  Homo floresiensis \u2013 its\
