shownotes: "<p>Dr. Rebecca Tuvel is Associate Professor and Chair of Philosophy at\
  \ Rhodes College. She works in feminist philosophy, philosophy of race, and the\
  \ ethics of identity. Her book project Changing Race: The Ethics and Metaphysics\
  \ of Transracialism explores the possibility and permissibility of changing one\u2019\
  s race.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about feminism, cultural appropriation,\
  \ the philosophy of race, and animal ethics. We discuss what it means to be a feminist,\
  \ and why are there so few people identifying as feminists. We talk about feminism\
  \ and intersectionality today. We discuss if feminism should include trans women.\
  \ We talk about epistemic exclusions, the historical exclusion of women\u2019s knowledge,\
  \ and we discuss if there can also be injustices in epistemic inclusion. We discuss\
  \ if cultural appropriation is a problem. We talk about the philosophy of race,\
  \ and go through three main different philosophical approaches to race: race anti-realism,\
  \ social realism, and biological realism. We discuss transracialism, if people can\
  \ change their race, if they should be allowed to do so, and if it is analogous\
  \ to changing one\u2019s gender identity. Finally, we talk about animal ethics,\
  \ and discuss if we should use the knowledge that comes from animal experimentation.</p>\n"
