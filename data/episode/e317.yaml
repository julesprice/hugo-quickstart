shownotes: "<p>Dr. Khandis Blake is an evolutionary social psychologist at The University\
  \ of Melbourne. She is an expert in gendered conflict. Her research considers how\
  \ behavior, attitudes, and culture associated with gender are influenced by the\
  \ interplay between nature, nurture, and the state of the economy. Herself and her\
  \ collaborators propose that gendered phenomena such as inimate partner violence,\
  \ attitudes toward abortion, and male-male aggression arise partially out of market\
  \ conditions that shift the bargaining power between men and women. Second, she\
  \ investigates the causes and consequences of female competition and the conditions\
  \ under which female sexualization elevates women's agency. Third, she develops\
  \ methodological tools to advance the psychosocial study of female ovulation and\
  \ ovarian hormones. Finally, she is interested in the social contexts eliciting\
  \ aggression, especially male-to-female aggression and intimate partner violence.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about several issues regarding female intrasexual competition\
  \ in the modern world, gender inequality, and feminism from an evolutionary perspective.\
  \ We first discuss how women compete, and focus on aggressive behavior. We then\
  \ talk about intimate partner violence. We cover income inequality and effects on\
  \ women\u2019s intrasexual competition at several different levels, like the use\
  \ of cosmetics and social media. We also explore sexual objectification, and hypersexualization\
  \ in the West and the negative effects it might have on women. Finally, we talk\
  \ about integrating Women\u2019s Studies with Evolutionary Psychology to better\
  \ understand and tackle current feminist issues.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Blake\u2019\
