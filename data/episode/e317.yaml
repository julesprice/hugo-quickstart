shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 21st, 2020.  \nDr. Khandis Blake is an evolutionary\
  \ social psychologist at The University of Melbourne. She is an expert in gendered\
  \ conflict. Her research considers how behavior, attitudes, and culture associated\
  \ with gender are influenced by the interplay between nature, nurture, and the state\
  \ of the economy. Herself and her collaborators propose that gendered phenomena\
  \ such as inimate partner violence, attitudes toward abortion, and male-male aggression\
  \ arise partially out of market conditions that shift the bargaining power between\
  \ men and women. Second, she investigates the causes and consequences of female\
  \ competition and the conditions under which female sexualization elevates women's\
  \ agency. Third, she develops methodological tools to advance the psychosocial study\
  \ of female ovulation and ovarian hormones. Finally, she is interested in the social\
  \ contexts eliciting aggression, especially male-to-female aggression and intimate\
  \ partner violence.  \n\nIn this episode, we talk about several issues regarding\
  \ female intrasexual competition in the modern world, gender inequality, and feminism\
  \ from an evolutionary perspective. We first discuss how women compete, and focus\
  \ on aggressive behavior. We then talk about intimate partner violence. We cover\
  \ income inequality and effects on women\u2019s intrasexual competition at several\
  \ different levels, like the use of cosmetics and social media. We also explore\
  \ sexual objectification, and hypersexualization in the West and the negative effects\
  \ it might have on women. Finally, we talk about integrating Women\u2019s Studies\
  \ with Evolutionary Psychology to better understand and tackle current feminist\
  \ issues.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:41  Female intrasexual competition  \n04:09  Aggression\
