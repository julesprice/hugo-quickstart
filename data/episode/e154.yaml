shownotes: "Dr. Robert McCauley is the William Rand Kenan Jr. University Professor\
  \ of Philosophy at the Center for Mind, Brain, and Culture, at Emory University.\
  \ Dr. McCauley is a professor of philosophy, psychology, religion, and anthropology\
  \ who is a pioneer in the cognitive science of religion. He is also the author of\
  \ Why Religion Is Natural and Science Is Not and of Philosophical Foundations of\
  \ the Cognitive Science of Religion as well as the co-author with E. Thomas Lawson\
  \ of both Bringing Ritual to Mind: Psychological Foundations of Cultural Forms and\
  \ Rethinking Religion: Connecting Cognition and Culture.  Dr. McCauley is also the\
  \ editor of The Churchlands and Their Critics and the co-editor with Harvey Whitehouse\
  \ of Mind and Religion.\n\nIn this episode, we go through some of the basics of\
  \ the cognitive science of religion, and also how it goes through addressing the\
  \ study of religion in its biological, cognitive/psychological and cultural aspects.\
  \ We start by defining cognitive psychology of religion, and its methods. We then\
  \ address the relationship between biology and culture, and how to go from cognition\
  \ to culture. We talk briefly about some of the major cognitive bases of religion,\
  \ and the role that rituals play in religion. Dr. McCauley also goes through a slide\
  \ that summarizes the evolutionary approaches that we have to the study of religion,\
  \ including natural selection, sexual selection, group selection, and how they might\
  \ operate at the level of genetics, individuals and groups. And we finish off by\
  \ talking about the aspects in which religion is intuitive to people, and why science\
  \ is so counterintuitive, and also the relationship between science and religion.\n\
