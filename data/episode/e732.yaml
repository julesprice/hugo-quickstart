  <p>In this episode, we talk about metaethics, and practical philosophy. We start
  by distinguishing metaethics from normative ethics and applied ethics. We talk about
  the main questions and approaches in metaethics. We get specifically into moral
  error theory, moral abolitionism, and moral nihilism. We also discuss what moral
  facts are. We talk about moral certitude. Finally, we discuss what practical philosophy
  is, and how it relates to theoretical philosophy.</p>
