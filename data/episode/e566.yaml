  \ dominance of medication in practice; the proliferation of psychotherapies; the\

  \ trauma; the idea that mental disorders are mainly due to social and political\
  \ problems; we talk about overdiagnosis in conditions like depression, bipolar disorder,\
  \ ADHD, and PTSD; problems with the DSM system of classification of disorders; the\
