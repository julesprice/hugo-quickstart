  Research Associate in the Department of Psychiatry at Sir Mortimer B. Davis-Jewish
  General Hospital. His research interests include developmental factors in personality
  disorders (especially borderline personality), and culture and personality.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about current issues in psychiatric and psychotherapeutic
  practice. Topics include: historical fads in psychiatry, and what lessons can be
  drawn for the present; attempts of current theories to carry out biological reductionism;
  the dominance of medication in practice; the proliferation of psychotherapies; the
  belief that the most important psychological risk factor for mental illness is trauma;
  the idea that mental disorders are mainly due to social and political problems;
  we talk about overdiagnosis in conditions like depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD,
  and PTSD; problems with the DSM system of classification of disorders; the therapeutic
  relationship, and its importance in psychotherapy; and if psychiatry is well-equipped
  to preventing suicide.</p>
