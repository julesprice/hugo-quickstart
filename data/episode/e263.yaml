shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 24th, 2019.  \nDr. Mark Alfano is Associate Professor\
  \ of Philosophy at the Delft University of Technology and the Australian Catholic\
  \ University. Dr. Alfano uses tools and methods from philosophy and the sciences\
  \ to explore topics in moral psychology, epistemology, and digital humanities. He\
  \ studies how people become and remain virtuous, how values become integrated into\
  \ people's lives, and how these virtues and values are (or fail to be) manifested\
  \ in their perception, thoughts, feelings, deliberations, and behavior. One of the\
  \ guiding themes of his work is that moral philosophy without psychological content\
  \ is empty, but psychological investigation without philosophical insight is blind.\
  \ He\u2019s the author of books like Character as Moral Fiction, and Nietzsche's\
  \ Moral Psychology.\n\nIn this episode, we focus mostly of Dr. Alfano\u2019s work\
  \ on virtue ethics and moral character. We first get into issues regarding modern\
  \ accounts of virtue ethics, the objectivity (or lack thereof) of morality, and\
  \ what moral character is. We also refer to moral psychology, and the replication\
  \ crisis in Psychology, with particular emphasis on the literature from social psychology.\
  \ We talk about thick concepts of virtue ethics, and the is-ought dichotomy. Finally,\
  \ we address the situationist critique of virtue ethics, what we know about the\
  \ effects of labelling, and how personality might play a role in different people\
  \ being differentially susceptible to change. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:01  Modern virtue\
