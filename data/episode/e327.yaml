shownotes: "<p>Dr. Sarah Garfinkel is Professor of neuroscience and psychiatry based\
  \ at the University of Sussex and the Brighton and Sussex Medical School. Her research\
  \ is focused on the link between interoception and emotion and memory. In 2018,\
  \ she was selected as one of 11 researchers on the Nature Index 2018 Rising Stars.\
  \ Dr. Garfinkel's research focuses on interoception, the ability to sense one\u2019\
  s own body, and the link between interoception and the brain. She specifically focuses\
  \ on the heartbeat, and has shown that the heartbeat, and perception thereof, influences\
  \ the way people process fear. Her research has furthermore shown that autistic\
  \ people experience difficulty judging their heartbeat, causing anxiety and stress.\
  \ This research has led to the development of a new therapy technique called interoception-directed\
  \ therapy, which aims to reduce anxiety in autistic individuals.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we talk about interoception, and how it connects with emotion, cognition,\
  \ and mental health. We first answer what interoception is about, and how it connects\
  \ with how the brain works. We also discuss how emotions work, and connect them\
  \ with decision-making, and refer to memory and cognition. We then get into the\
  \ association between interoception and mental health and psychiatry, and we go\
  \ through several examples of mental disorder, like PTSD, addiction, autism, depression,\
  \ and anxiety.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Garfinkel\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty\
