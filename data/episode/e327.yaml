shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 20th, 2020.  \nDr. Sarah Garfinkel is Professor of\
  \ neuroscience and psychiatry based at the University of Sussex and the Brighton\
  \ and Sussex Medical School. Her research is focused on the link between interoception\
  \ and emotion and memory. In 2018, she was selected as one of 11 researchers on\
  \ the Nature Index 2018 Rising Stars. Dr. Garfinkel's research focuses on interoception,\
  \ the ability to sense one\u2019s own body, and the link between interoception and\
  \ the brain. She specifically focuses on the heartbeat, and has shown that the heartbeat,\
  \ and perception thereof, influences the way people process fear. Her research has\
  \ furthermore shown that autistic people experience difficulty judging their heartbeat,\
  \ causing anxiety and stress. This research has led to the development of a new\
  \ therapy technique called interoception-directed therapy, which aims to reduce\
  \ anxiety in autistic individuals.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about interoception,\
  \ and how it connects with emotion, cognition, and mental health. We first answer\
  \ what interoception is about, and how it connects with how the brain works. We\
  \ also discuss how emotions work, and connect them with decision-making, and refer\
  \ to memory and cognition. We then get into the association between interoception\
  \ and mental health and psychiatry, and we go through several examples of mental\
  \ disorder, like PTSD, addiction, autism, depression, and anxiety.\n\nTime Links:\
