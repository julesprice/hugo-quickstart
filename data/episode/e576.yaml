shownotes: "Dr. Tania Reynolds is Assistant Professor in Psychology at the University\
  \ of New Mexico.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about male suffering, female same-sex\
  \ relationships, discrimination in hiring, and moral reactions to covid-19 health\
  \ responses. We start by talking about the ways men suffer and how they get derogated,\
  \ and the evolutionary bases to all of that. We go into biases in moral typecasting,\
  \ and discuss if people are insensitive to male suffering. We then get into what\
  \ women evolved to look for in same-sex relationship, as well as the challenges\
  \ they pose. We speculate a bit on the relationships women establish with their\
  \ mothers-in-law, in the light of parent-offspring conflict. We talk about how women\
  \ disguise intrasexual competition as prosociality or vulnerability. We also discuss\
  \ how this applies to the modern workplace, and possible interventions to help women\
  \ navigate these relationships. We then talk about racial discrimination in the\
  \ hiring process, and the role played by ideology and \u201Cressentiment\u201D.\
  \ We also discuss if the same applies to other kinds of discrimination. Finally,\
  \ we ask if there moral reactions might stem from pathogen disgust.\n\nTime Links:\
