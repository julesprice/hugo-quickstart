shownotes: "<p>Dr. Adam Bulley is a postdoctoral fellow at the Brain and Mind Centre\
  \ and School of Psychology, The University of Sydney, and the Department of Psychology\
  \ at Harvard University. \_He is the author (together with Thomas Suddendorf and\
  \ Jonathan Redshaw) of The Invention of Tomorrow: A Natural History of Foresight.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we focus on The Invention of Tomorrow. We start with the evolution\
  \ of foresight; and talk about life history theory, and how foresight is a universal\
  \ human trait. We discuss its development. We get into the particular case of the\
  \ Pirah\xE3. We talk about foresight in other animals and extinct hominin species.\
  \ We discuss the neuroscience of foresight, and how it relates to memory, including\
  \ how dementia affects both memory and foresight. We discuss how foresight might\
  \ have driven cultural evolution, and how cultural artifacts enhance foresight.\
  \ Finally, we talk about the role of foresight in the development of the modern\
  \ era, particularly the scientific method, and we discuss if people in industrialized\
  \ societies really have longer time horizons.</p>\n"
