  \ - a Case Study of Understanding, and How We Misunderstand Economics And Why It\
  \ Matters: The Psychology of Bias, Distortion and Conspiracy.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we focus on How We Misunderstand Economics and Why It Matters. We start by talking\
  \ about people\u2019s intuitions about economic issues. We go through some of the\
  \ psychological phenomena that distance people from economic theory - the law of\
  \ unintended consequences, the intentionality bias, opportunity cost neglect, and\
  \ the denial of tradeoffs. We talk about how people think about unemployment and\
  \ inflation, and what economists know about them. We discuss the effects of political\
  \ ideology, moral values, and the metaphors people use. We talk about how people\
  \ think about capitalism. Finally, we discuss if the public needs more education\
  \ on economics, and how to do it.</p>\n"
