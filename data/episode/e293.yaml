shownotes: "<p>Dr. Kristin Andrews is York Research Chair in Animal Minds and Professor\
  \ of Philosophy at York University (Toronto), where she also helps coordinate the\
  \ Cognitive Science program and the Toronto Area Animal Cognition Discussion Group.\
  \ Dr. Andrews is on the board of directors of the Borneo Orangutan Society Canada,\
  \ a member of the College of the Royal Society of Canada, and the author of several\
  \ books on social minds, animal minds, and ethics.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk\
  \ about how to properly study animal minds, and also issues regarding animal ethics.\
  \ We start by discussing how difficult it is to study non-human animals\u2019 behavior\
  \ and minds, and Dr. Andrews presents the calibration method. We also discuss how\
  \ we can use folk psychology as a starting point. We talk about the flaws with anthropomorphism\
  \ and anthropectomy. We then get into the issue of theory of mind, and how to deal\
  \ with consciousness in animal cognitive studies. Dr. Andrews also refers to recent\
  \ exciting research that points to the possibility of plants also having consciousness\
  \ and minds. Finally, we get into animal ethics, and discuss specifically issues\
  \ related to how we can determine if there are other animals that also are moral\
  \ agents, and how to study moral normativity in non-human animals. We end up by\
  \ talking a bit about veganism.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Andrews\u2019 work:</p>\n\
