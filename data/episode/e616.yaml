  \nIn this episode, we talk about environmental philosophy. We start by exploring\
  \ what environmental philosophy is, a bit of its history, and the questions it deals\
  \ it. We then focus on environmental ethics, and paradigms like evolutionary moral\
  \ psychology and rational individualism. We discuss the relationship between environmental\
  \ ethics and environmental science. We talk about climate change, solutions to it,\
  \ the role of philosophers, and if we can be optimistic about it. Finally, we ask\
  \ what we can learn from Eastern philosophy.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:52\
