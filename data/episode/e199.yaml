  <p>In this episode, we focus on political radicalization mechanisms. We talk about\
  \ the three levels of political radicalization (individual, group, mass), and some\
  \ of the main mechanisms that go associated with them, with particular focus on\
  \ social disconnection, grievance (individual and group), and slippery slope processes.\
  \ We also discuss how people react to threats and what they perceive to be social\
  \ and political instability. We also cover essentialist thinking and dehumanization,\
  \ and the hard-to-understand cases of self-sacrifice and lone-wolf terrorism. Toward\
  \ the end, we also have time to discuss the mismatch between ideology and action,\
  \ and some solutions to counter (and mostly to prevent) political radicalization.</p>\n\
