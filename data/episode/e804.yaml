shownotes: "<p>Dr. Deborah Gordon is a Professor in the Department of Biology at Stanford\
  \ University. She studies how ant colonies work without central control using networks\
  \ of simple interactions, and how these networks evolve in relation to changing\
  \ environments.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about ant colonies. We discuss\
  \ decision-making from an ecological perspective, and distributed problem solving.\
  \ We talk about the tole of genetics and the environment in ant sociality. We discuss\
  \ task allocation, and why \u201Cdivision of labor\u201D is not a good term to apply\
  \ here. We talk about how ants recognize nestmates. We discuss genetic relatedness,\
  \ kin selection, group selection, and the debate surrounding levels of selection\
  \ in evolutionary biology. We talk about ant personality. We discuss if there are\
  \ hierarchies or caste systems in ant colonies. Finally, we discuss if the study\
  \ of ants can help us understand other systems that work without central control,\
  \ and if we can extrapolate from ants to humans.</p>\n"
