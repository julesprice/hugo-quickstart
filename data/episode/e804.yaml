shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 9th 2023.  \nDr. Deborah Gordon is a Professor in the\
  \ Department of Biology at Stanford University. She studies how ant colonies work\
  \ without central control using networks of simple interactions, and how these networks\
  \ evolve in relation to changing environments. Her projects include a long-term\
  \ study of a population of harvester ant colonies in Arizona, studies of the invasive\
  \ Argentine ant in northern California, arboreal ant trail networks and ant-plant\
  \ mutualisms in Central America.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about ant colonies.\
  \ We discuss decision-making from an ecological perspective, and distributed problem\
  \ solving. We talk about the tole of genetics and the environment in ant sociality.\
  \ We discuss task allocation, and why \u201Cdivision of labor\u201D is not a good\
  \ term to apply here. We talk about how ants recognize nestmates. We discuss genetic\
  \ relatedness, kin selection, group selection, and the debate surrounding levels\
  \ of selection in evolutionary biology. We talk about ant personality. We discuss\
  \ if there are hierarchies or caste systems in ant colonies. Finally, we discuss\
  \ if the study of ants can help us understand other systems that work without central\
  \ control, and if we can extrapolate from ants to humans.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
