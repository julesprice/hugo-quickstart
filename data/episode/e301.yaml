  \ research centers on investigating human ocular, orbital, midfacial, cerebral and\
  \ neurocranial morphology, and how competition among these features may act to constrain\
  \ the eye and surrounding ocular tissues during ontogeny, as it relates to the disparate\
  \ incidence &amp; severity of astigmatism and juvenile-onset myopia. Further research\
  \ interests center on investigating hominin biocultural evolution, astrobiology,\

  \ Approach to the UFO Phenomenon.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on the thesis\
  \ that Dr. Masters puts forward in his book, where he tries to explain the UFO phenomenon\
  \ as being humans from the future backward time travelling. We go through the unreliability\
  \ of the personal reports, and why we have to be careful about that. Then we get\
  \ into the biological anthropology bit, and refer to trends in the evolution of\
  \ the human body, mostly the head, for the past 6 million years, and how it could\
  \ continue into the future. We also address the theoretical bases of time travel,\
  \ and its many complications. Finally, we discuss what people from the future could\
  \ have to gain from travelling back to the past.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Masters\u2019\
