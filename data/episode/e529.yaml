shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 21st 2021.  \nDr. David Pietraszewski is Research\
  \ Scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. He is an experimental\
  \ psychologist who applies evolutionary theorizing to Social, Cognitive, and Developmental\
  \ questions. He is particularly interested in characterizing the psychology of multi-agent\
  \ conflict and cooperation (\"coalitional psychology\"). The goal of his research\
  \ is to not simply describe behavior, but rather to use behavior to make inferences\
  \ about the mind---described at the level of mechanisms (or functions). He also\
  \ does theoretical work to address common confusions surrounding this approach.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about modularity of mind and coalitional psychology.\
  \ In terms of modularity of mind, we cover topics like: Fodorian modularity, modularity\
  \ in evolutionary psychology, and different levels of analysis when thinking about\
  \ modularity. In terms of coalitional psychology, we talk about what it is from\
  \ an evolutionary perspective, social categorization and the categories people pay\
  \ attention to, race, the relationship between coalitional psychology and politics,\
  \ and hierarchy and leadership in human societies.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
