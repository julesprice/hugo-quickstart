shownotes: "UPDATE: Fran\xE7oise Baylis \u201CDeliberate Design: The Ethics of Human\
  \ Genome Editing\u201D (forthcoming, Harvard University Press, 2019).\n\nDr. Fran\xE7\
  oise Baylis is University Research Professor at Dalhousie University, Canada. She\
  \ is a frequent guest on CBC and Radio Canada. The focus of her research is on issues\
  \ of women's health and assisted reproductive technologies, but her research and\
  \ publication record also extend to such topics as research involving humans (including\
  \ human embryo research), gene editing, novel genetic technologies, public health,\
  \ the role of bioethics consultants, and neuroethics. She has a forthcoming book\
  \ on ethics and heritable genome editing with Harvard University Press.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about the ethics behind CRISPR-cas9 genome editing technology.\
  \ The difference between using it in somatic cells versus germline cells; he fuzzy\
  \ line that separates enhancement from therapy; the example of improving IQ; how\
  \ this technology can increase the gap between rich and poor, taking it to the whole\
  \ new level of biological differences; individual and social considerations; and\
  \ animal ethics. We finish off by talking a little bit about Dr. Baylis\u2019 upcoming\
  \ book.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:02  What is CRISPR-cas9?  \n03:22  It can be used in\
  \ any type of living cell                    \n04:25  Applying it in somatic vs\
  \ germline cells         \n06:24  Its possible applications in humans          \n\

  \   \n16:43  The complicated example of improving IQ  \n22:52  Can we cause problems\
  \ by reducing genetic diversity?  \n26:07  Eugenics  \n29:51  Looking at genetic\
  \ engineering from a societal perspective  \n33:09  The many ethical aspects to\
  \ be evaluated  \n37:28  Animal ethics  \n40:25  Dr. Baylis\u2019 forthcoming book\
