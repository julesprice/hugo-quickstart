shownotes: "<p>Dr. Edward Slingerland is a Professor of Asian Studies at the University\
  \ of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. His most recent book is Drunk: How We\
  \ Sipped, Danced, and Stumbled Our Way to Civilization.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we focus on Drunk. We first talk about alcohol consumption during our evolutionary\
  \ history. We discuss the particular case of East Asians, and their difficulty in\
  \ metabolically processing alcohol. We compare alcohol to other intoxicants, and\
  \ talk about its social benefits, considering that humans are communal, creative\
  \ and cultural. We mention the role it might have played in the development of the\
  \ arts, and also how it is used in religious rituals. We discuss the negative effects\
  \ of alcohol, and how people moderate its use. We talk about how experience pleasure\
  \ for pleasure\u2019s sake is also a good thing, and how Nietzsche praised Dionysian\
  \ experiences. We also talk about prejudices against alcohol, and go through some\
  \ of the evolutionary mismatches we face in our modern industrialized societies,\
  \ with focus on the presence of distilled liquors and drinking in isolation. Finally,\
  \ we discuss possible alternatives to alcohol, and how we should expose young people\
  \ to alcohol.</p>\n"
