shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 7th 2021.  \nDr. Edward Slingerland is a Professor of\
  \ Asian Studies at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. He\u2019\
  s the Director of the Cultural Evolution of Religion Research Consortium (CERC),\
  \ the Director of the Database of Religious History (DRH), and the Co-Director of\
  \ the Centre for the Study of Human Evolution, Cognition and Culture (HECC). His\
  \ most recent book is Drunk: How We Sipped, Danced, and Stumbled Our Way to Civilization.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on Drunk. We first talk about alcohol consumption during\
  \ our evolutionary history. We discuss the particular case of East Asians, and their\
  \ difficulty in metabolically processing alcohol. We compare alcohol to other intoxicants,\
  \ and talk about its social benefits, considering that humans are communal, creative\
  \ and cultural. We mention the role it might have played in the development of the\
  \ arts, and also how it is used in religious rituals. We discuss the negative effects\
  \ of alcohol, and how people moderate its use. We talk about how experience pleasure\
  \ for pleasure\u2019s sake is also a good thing, and how Nietzsche praised Dionysian\
  \ experiences. We also talk about prejudices against alcohol, and go through some\
  \ of the evolutionary mismatches we face in our modern industrialized societies,\
  \ with focus on the presence of distilled liquors and drinking in isolation. Finally,\
  \ we discuss possible alternatives to alcohol, and how we should expose young people\
  \ to alcohol.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:28  Alcohol in our evolutionary\
