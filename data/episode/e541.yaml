shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 29th 2021.  \nDr. Charles Foster is a Fellow of\
  \ Green Templeton College, a member of the Oxford Law Faculty (where he is a Visiting\
  \ Professor), a Senior Research Associate at the Uehiro Institute for Practical\
  \ Ethics (within the Faculty of Philosophy), and a Research Associate at the Ethox\
  \ Centre and the Helex Centre (both within the Faculty of Medicine). His main areas\
  \ of interest are medical law and ethics. Recently he has been focused particularly\
  \ on questions of identity, personhood, and authenticity, on whether theories of\
  \ human dignity can do any real work in the law, and on the use of intuitions in\
  \ moral and legal reasoning. He is the author of many books, including his most\
  \ recent one, Being a Human: Adventures in Forty Thousand Years of Consciousness.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on Being a Human. We talk about how human sociality\
  \ changed from the Upper Paleolithic to the Neolithic, and how human conscious experience\
  \ evolved. We also touch on how the Enlightenment changed people\u2019s perception\
  \ of the world.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:40  The Upper Paleolithic  \n\
