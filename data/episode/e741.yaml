shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 14th 2022.  \nDr. Marya Schechtman is an LAS Distinguished\
  \ Professor of Philosophy, as well as a member of the Laboratory of Integrative\
  \ Neuroscience at the University of Illinois Chicago. Her main areas of interest\
  \ are personal identity, practical reasoning, and bioethics. She is the author of\
  \ books like The Constitution of Selves (Cornell 1996), and Staying Alive: Personal\
  \ Identity, Practical Concerns, and the Unity of a Life (Oxford 2014).\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about the self. We start by discussing what the self is, and\
  \ its relationship with personal identity. We discuss if it is a narrative, if it\
  \ is unitary, and if coherence is important. We also talk about the social aspects\
  \ of the self, and ask if we can develop separate selves in virtual worlds.\n\n\
