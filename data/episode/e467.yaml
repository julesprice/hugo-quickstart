  <p>In this episode, we focus on Threats. We start by talking about threats from\
  \ an evolutionary perspective, and the kinds of behaviors and even human institutions\
  \ that derive from how we evolved to process threats. We discuss deterrence behavior\
  \ more specifically. In the second part of the interview, we talk about nuclear\
  \ deterrence, the several issues and limitations with the theory behind it, and\
  \ also demilitarization in Costa Rica.</p>\n"
