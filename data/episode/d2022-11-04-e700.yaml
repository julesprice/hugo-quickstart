shownotes: "<p>Dr. Claudio Tennie is a Tenured Research Group Leader (\u201CTools\
  \ and Culture among Early Hominins\u201D) in the Department of Early Prehistory\
  \ and Quaternary Ecology at the University of T\xFCbingen. His main research triangulates\
  \ what makes human cognition unique - as well as why.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we\
  \ talk about tool behaviors, and culture. We start with tool behaviors in apes,\
  \ including flaked stone tools in orangutans and chimpanzees, and food cleaning\
  \ in gorillas. We talk about what might have been the tool behaviors of early hominins.\
  \ We discuss what we can learn by studying chimpanzees in captivity, and the psychological\
  \ mechanisms that underly the acquisition of tool behaviors. We talk about children\
  \ spontaneously inventing tool use behaviors, and cultural behaviors that do not\
  \ need cultural transmission. We ask if human cognition is unique, and get into\
  \ high-fidelity social learning and over-imitation. We talk about cumulative culture,\
  \ the role teaching and curiosity play in it, and what distinguishes human culture\
  \ from chimpanzee culture. Finally, we discuss if science can be understood from\
  \ a cultural evolutionary perspective.</p>\n"
