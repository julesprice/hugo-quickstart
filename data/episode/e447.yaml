shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 11th 2021.  \nDr. William Keith Campbell is a professor\
  \ in the Department of Psychology in the University of Georgia's Franklin College\
  \ of Arts and Sciences. He has published over 120 peer-reviewed papers and a number\
  \ of books, including The Handbook of Narcissism and Narcissistic Personality Disorder:\
  \ Theoretical Approaches, Empirical Findings, and Treatments (with Joshua Miller)\
  \ and The Narcissism Epidemic: Living in the Age of Entitlement (with Jean Twenge).\
  \ Dr. Keith Campbell\u2019s new book, in collaboration with Grady College alumna\
  \ Carolyn Crist, was recently released: \u201CThe New Science of Narcissism: Understanding\
  \ one of the greatest Psychological challenges of our time \u2013 and what you can\
  \ do about it\u201D.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The New Science of Narcissism.\
  \ First we define narcissism. We talk about its heritability, and the relationship\
  \ with the Big Five personality traits, and with the Dark Triad. We discuss the\
  \ benefits and costs of narcissism, for the narcissist and for the people around\
  \ him. We refer to Trump, and ask if mental health professionals should diagnose\
  \ political figures. We talk about social media and its relationship with narcissism.\
  \ We ask if it is possible to reduce levels of narcissism in individuals, and also\
  \ who should seek therapy. Toward the end, we talk about the cultural aspects of\
  \ mental disorders, and the questions about narcissism we have yet to answer.\n\n\
