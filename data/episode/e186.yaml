shownotes: "Dr. Felix Warneken is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology\
  \ at the University of Michigan. He\u2019s interested in Developmental Psychology;\
  \ Culture; Cognition; and Comparative Animal Behavior. His research group addresses\
  \ questions like how and why human social life involves complex interactions between\
  \ individuals working together, and what cognitive skills allow them to do so. They\
  \ do so by examining the earliest forms of cooperation in young children, untangling\
  \ the processes shaping cooperation across development in different sociocultural\
  \ contexts, and comparing human cooperation with that of our closest evolutionary\
  \ relatives, the great Apes.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about cooperation in the\
  \ great Apes and human infants. First, we discuss the proper ways of talking about\
  \ seemingly disparate behaviors, like cooperation, helping, and altruism. Then,\
  \ we refer to how crucial it is for us to know how social cognition works in different\
  \ species. We also address the problem of establishing a biological basis for behavior,\
  \ and how to deal with sociocultural and behaviorist explanations, without disregarding\
  \ environmental influences. We then talk about kin selection, reciprocal altruism,\
  \ in-group favoritism, deception, and other mechanisms that operate in both humans\
  \ and other close primates. Toward the end, we talk about what distinguishes humans\
  \ from other primates at the level of social cognition.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:11\
