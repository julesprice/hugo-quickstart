shownotes: "<p>Dr. Felix Warneken is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology\
  \ at the University of Michigan. He\u2019s interested in Developmental Psychology;\
  \ Culture; Cognition; and Comparative Animal Behavior. His research group addresses\
  \ questions like how and why human social life involves complex interactions between\
  \ individuals working together, and what cognitive skills allow them to do so. They\
  \ do so by examining the earliest forms of cooperation in young children, untangling\
  \ the processes shaping cooperation across development in different sociocultural\
  \ contexts, and comparing human cooperation with that of our closest evolutionary\
  \ relatives, the great Apes.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about cooperation\
  \ in the great Apes and human infants. First, we discuss the proper ways of talking\
  \ about seemingly disparate behaviors, like cooperation, helping, and altruism.\
  \ Then, we refer to how crucial it is for us to know how social cognition works\
  \ in different species. We also address the problem of establishing a biological\
  \ basis for behavior, and how to deal with sociocultural and behaviorist explanations,\
  \ without disregarding environmental influences. We then talk about kin selection,\
  \ reciprocal altruism, in-group favoritism, deception, and other mechanisms that\
  \ operate in both humans and other close primates. Toward the end, we talk about\
  \ what distinguishes humans from other primates at the level of social cognition.</p>\n\
