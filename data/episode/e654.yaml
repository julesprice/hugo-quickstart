shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 2nd 2022.  \nDr. Russell Blackford is a Fellow of the\
  \ Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, and a Laureate of the International\
  \ Academy of Humanism. He holds an honorary appointment as Conjoint Senior Lecturer\
  \ in Philosophy at the University of Newcastle. He is the author of several books,\
  \ including Freedom of Religion and the Secular State, 50 Great Myths About Atheism,\
  \ The Mystery of Moral Authority, and The Tyranny of Opinion: Conformity and the\
  \ Future of Liberalism.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about religion, atheism, science,\
  \ and morality. We start with religious freedom, and the modern secular state. We\
  \ define atheism, and get into the conflict between religion and science. We then\
  \ talk about moral authority, the objectivity of morality, moral skepticism, and\
  \ the relationship between moral nihilism and atheism.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
