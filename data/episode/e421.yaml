  <p>In this episode, we talk about Cultural Psychology. We start with some basic
  questions, regarding the field of cultural psychology, and what is culture. We then
  go through several topics like: where does cultural variation come from?; ways of
  classifying different cultures; differences in psychological mechanisms influenced
  by culture, and if these are permanent; a sensitive period for acculturation; and
  how cultures have changed over time. We talk about specific psychological mechanisms
  whose universality has recently been questioned, including: the endowment effect;
  the similarity-attraction effect; overconfidence; cognitive dissonance; the fundamental
  attribution error; and how people experience mental illness. Toward the end we also
  discuss how ideas spread in societies, and I ask Dr. Heine what are some of the
  most interesting questions that Cultural Psychology has yet to answer.</p>
