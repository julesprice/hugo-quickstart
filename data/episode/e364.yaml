shownotes: "<p>In this episode, we talk about many questions that Psycholinguistics\
  \ tries to answer. We ask what why child development is so important for linguistics,\
  \ and if language is innate, including the poverty of the stimulus argument. We\
  \ also question if it is really so difficult for adults to acquire a second language.\
  \ We then discuss the cultural evolution of language, and how we can compare humans\
  \ to other species. We talk about sign language and creole language. And, finally,\
  \ we talk about Dr. Raviv\u2019s work on how the social structure of the environment\
  \ affects the grammatical structure of languages, and the limitations of lab studies.</p>\n\
