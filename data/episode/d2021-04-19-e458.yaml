shownotes: "<p>Dr. Lesley Newson is honorary post-doc at University of California,\
  \ Davis.</p>\n<p>Dr. Peter Richerson is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of the\
  \ Department of Environmental Science and Policy at the University of California,\
  \ Davis. He\u2019s also the author of books like Culture and the Evolutionary Process,\
  \ Not by Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution, and The Origin and\
  \ Evolution of Cultures, all written in collaboration with Dr. Robert Boyd.</p>\n\
  <p>They are both authors of a recent book, A Story of Us: A New Look at Human Evolution.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we focus on A Story of Us. We start with general questions:\
  \ the relationship between biology and culture; gene-culture coevolution; human\
  \ behavioral flexibility; and human universals. We then get into the evolutionary\
  \ story presented in the book, and go through: our last common ancestor with chimpanzees\
  \ and bonobos; bipedal apes from 3 million years ago; early humans from 1.5 million\
  \ years ago; humans from 100.000 years ago; human societies from 30.000 and 10.000\
  \ years ago; and modernity. We also discuss the concept of \u201Csocial tools\u201D\
  , and the importance of our life history in our evolution. We talk about current\
  \ and future challenges. We then go back to some general questions, and discuss\
  \ some criticisms of evolutionary psychology; group selection; social selection;\
  \ and \u201Chuman nature\u201D. We finish with a question from a patron.</p>\n"
