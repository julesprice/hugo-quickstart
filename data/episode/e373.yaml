shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 17th, 2020.  \nDr. Melanie Mitchell is the Davis Professor\
  \ of Complexity at the Santa Fe Institute, and Professor of Computer Science at\
  \ Portland State University.  Her current research focuses on conceptual abstraction,\
  \ analogy-making, and visual recognition in artificial intelligence systems. Dr.\
  \ Mitchell is the author or editor of six books and numerous scholarly papers in\
  \ the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and complex systems.\
  \ Her book Complexity: A Guided Tour (Oxford University Press) won the 2010 Phi\
  \ Beta Kappa Science Book Award and was named by Amazon.com as one of the ten best\
  \ science books of 2009. Her latest book is Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for\
  \ Thinking Humans (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ AI. First, we ask if we are close to human-level AI, and also if the Turing test\
  \ is really that relevant. Dr. Mitchell explains deep learning and neural networks,\
  \ evolutionary computation, complex systems, and genetic algorithms. Then we get\
  \ into conceptual abstraction, analogy-making, and visual recognition. We also discuss\
  \ if AI systems should have built-in features (innate features). Finally, we talk\
  \ about the impact that AI already has on our lives.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:03  Are\
