shownotes: "<p>Dr. Robert A. Burton graduated from Yale University and the University\
  \ of California at San Francisco medical school, where he also completed his neurology\
  \ residency. At age thirty-three, he was appointed chief of the Division of Neurology\
  \ at UCSF Medical Center at Mt. Zion, where he subsequently became Associate Chief\
  \ of the Department of Neurosciences. His books include On Being Certain: Believing\
  \ You Are Right Even When You're Not, A Skeptic's Guide to the Mind; What Neuroscience\
  \ Can and Cannot Tell Us About Ourselves, and three critically acclaimed novels.\
  \ He has also written essays, book reviews and op-ed pieces for the New York Times,\
  \ Salon.com, Aeon, and Nautilus.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on some of the\
  \ main topics of Dr. Burton\u2019s books. We talk about the feelings of knowing,\
  \ certainty, familiarity, clarity of thought, and d\xE9j\xE0 vu that we have. We\
  \ also refer to phenomena like moral dumbfounding and post-hoc rationalization.\
  \ We discuss the problem with our view of how reason and rationality work, and how\
  \ we are mistaken about how our own thinking works. We also talk about how different\
  \ people see the world in different ways, our individual differences, and how religiosity\
  \ is not going away anytime soon. We refer to the placebo effect, and also to how\
  \ scientists have to be careful about how their own intuitions might affect how\
  \ they study the human mind. We end up by discussing a possible way to improve the\
  \ way we think, through a process of cultural evolution.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow\
