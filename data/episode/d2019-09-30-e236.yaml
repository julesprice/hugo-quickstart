shownotes: "<p>Dr. Sarah Hill is Associate Professor of Psychology at Texas Christian\
  \ University. She studies a range of topics, applying an evolutionary lens, including\
  \ the interplay between immune function and mating strategies; the impact of inflammation;\
  \ poverty, food regulation, and weight gain; hormonal contraceptives and mate choice;\
  \ and other topics under the rubric of life history theory. She is just about to\
  \ release a book, This Is Your Brain on Birth Control: The Surprising Science of\
  \ Women, Hormones, and the Law of Unintended Consequences.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we focus on Dr. Hill\u2019s upcoming book, This is Your Brain on Birth Control,\
  \ and go through some of its main topics, like: how women\u2019s behavior changes\
  \ through their menstrual cycles, and the ovulatory-shift hypothesis; concealed\
  \ ovulation; the different types of birth control, and their effects on women and\
  \ people around them. We also talk about why studying biological sex differences\
  \ is important and is not dangerous at all, the ways the pill empowered women, and\
  \ also how it might have changed the dynamics in the mating market, including their\
  \ effects on men.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Hill\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty\
