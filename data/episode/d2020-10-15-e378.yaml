shownotes: "<p>Dr. Brian Hare is a professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke\
  \ University. He researches the evolution of cognition by studying both humans,\
  \ our close relatives the primates (especially bonobos and chimpanzees), and species\
  \ whose cognition converged with our own (primarily domestic dogs). He founded and\
  \ co-directs the Duke Canine Cognition Center. He\u2019s the author of several books,\
  \ including the most recent one, Survival of the Friendliest: Understanding Our\
  \ Origins and Rediscovering Our Common Humanity.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk\
  \ about his book, Survival of the Friendliest. First, we go through some of the\
  \ psychological mechanism that allow for our friendliness, and later we also refer\
  \ to empathy, self-control, and theory of mind. We discuss the process of self-domestication.\
  \ We also talk about simianization, Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and Right\
  \ Wing Authoritarianism (RWA), and ways to increase our friendliness toward out-groups.</p>\n\
