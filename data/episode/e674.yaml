shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 18th 2022.  \nDr. Bianca Acevedo is an Instructor at\
  \ New York University. She is a social neuroscientist whose research focuses on\
  \ the neural basis of attachment, caregiving, sensory processing sensitivity (and\
  \ related disorders), and mind-body interventions. She conducted the first neuroimaging\
  \ studies of long-term pair-bonding in humans for which she was awarded the 2012\
  \ International Women in Science Award. She joined the NRI in 2016 where she has\
  \ been examining empathy in caregivers of ADRD individuals. Dr. Acevedo is interested\
  \ in understanding the biological basis of human attachment and sensory processing\
  \ sensitivity. In addition, her research examines the neural and behavioral outcomes\
  \ associated with engaging in mind-body practices in clinical and normative individuals\
  \ and dyads.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about attachment from a neuroscientific\
  \ perspective. We get into romantic love, and relationship satisfaction. We discuss\
  \ sensory processing sensitivity, and its relationship with mental disorders like\
  \ depression. Finally, we talk about social neuroscience, and how social psychology\
  \ intersects with neuroscience.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:29  Attachment\
