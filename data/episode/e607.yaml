  addiction, and the physiology of sexual response. She is also the founder of Liberos
  LLC, an independent research institute.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about sex, porn, and addiction. We start with sex, and
  hypersexual people. We then get into porn, and ask if it can be addictive, and talk
  about the relationship between porn consumption and sex drive, the effects of masturbation,
  the (negative) psychological effects of watching porn, and if it can affect relationship
  satisfaction and self/partner evaluations. We also discuss if the porn industry
  is bad for its performers; if the brain processes sex and porn differently; and
  who condemns porn, and who reports suffering from porn addiction.</p>
