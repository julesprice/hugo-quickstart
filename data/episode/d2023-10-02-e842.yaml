shownotes: "<p>Dr. Kevin Mitchell is Associate Professor of Genetics and Neuroscience\
  \ at Trinity College Dublin. He is interested in the development of connectivity\
  \ in the brain, specifically in how this process is controlled by genes and how\
  \ mutations in such genes affect the connectivity of neuronal circuits, influence\
  \ behavior and perception and contribute to disease. His latest book is Free Agents:\
  \ How Evolution Gave Us Free Will.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus\
  \ on Free Agents. We start by discussing how scientists approach free will, and\
  \ if we should define free will. We go through some of the major steps in the evolution\
  \ of free will, and talk about the origins of life on Earth; informational causation;\
  \ the purpose of life; meaning and value; the evolution of decision making; agency;\
  \ the evolution of nervous systems; the neocortex; and self-awareness. We talk about\
  \ how we simulate different courses of action, and how we should understand decision\
  \ making as a process. We discuss indeterminacy in Physics and Neuroscience. We\
  \ talk about the Libet experiments, and studies of brain legions. We discuss personality\
  \ traits and other psychological predispositions. We talk about constraints and\
  \ top-down causation. Finally, we discuss the link between free will and moral responsibility.</p>\n"
