  \ of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and\
  \ co-founder with Jane Goodall of Ethologists for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.\
  \ He has won many awards for his scientific research including the Exemplar Award\
  \ from the Animal Behavior Society and a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 2005, Dr. Bekoff\
  \ was presented with The Bank One Faculty Community Service Award for the work he\
  \ has done with children, senior citizens, and prisoners and in 2009 he was presented\
  \ with the St. Francis of Assisi Award by the New Zealand SPCA. In 1986 He became\
  \ the first American to win his age-class at the Tour du Haut Var bicycle race (also\
  \ called the Master's/age-graded Tour de France). Dr. Bekoff has published numerous\
  \ essays (popular, scientific, and book chapters), 31 books, and has edited three\
  \ encyclopedias. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about animal conservation. We first\
  \ set a theoretical framework, about animal minds, cognitive ethology, individual\
  \ variation, anthropomorphism and intentionality, and play behavior. We then get\
  \ into the meat of animal conservation, particularly its compassionate version."
