shownotes: "Dr. Redouan Bshary is Ordinary Professor of Eco-ethology at the Universit\xE9\
  \ de Neuch\xE2tel, Switzerland. His research is focused on cooperation within and\
  \ between species (mutualism), making use of game theoretic models. He also studies\
  \ links between game theoretic approaches, animal cognition and behavioral endocrinology.\
  \ \n\nIn this episode, we talk about game theory in the studying of animal social\
  \ behavior. Topics include cleaning mutualism in fish; the cognitive tools necessary\
  \ for social behavior; what are evolutionarily stable strategies; the importance\
  \ of the environment and development, and not just genetics; endocrinology and behavior;\
  \ one-on-one vs collective dynamics; group selection in humans.\n\nTime Links: \
