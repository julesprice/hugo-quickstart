shownotes: "<p>Dr. Peter Ditto is Professor of Psychological Science at UC Irvine\
  \ School of Social Ecology. His research examines the role of motivation, emotion\
  \ and intuition in social, political, moral, medical, and legal judgment. Most generally,\
  \ he has sought to explain the phenomenon of \u201Cmotivated reasoning\u201D \u2014\
  \ how the desire to reach a particular conclusion biases the processing of information\
  \ related to that conclusion. Another key focus of his current research is partisan\
  \ political bias.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about motivated reasoning, morality,\
  \ and politics. We start with motivated reasoning, what it is, and the domains where\
  \ it applies. We apply it to medical decision-making. We discuss how moral reasoning\
  \ works, moral intuitions, moral foundations, and the connection between morality\
  \ and politics. We talk about political bias and science denial on the left and\
  \ the right. We discuss the special case of libertarians. Finally, we talk about\
  \ how we should think about the relation between personality and politics, and personality\
  \ and morality, and Dr. Ditto gives an evolutionary rationale for motivated reasoning\
  \ and political behavior.</p>\n"
