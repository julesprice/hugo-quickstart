shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 11th, 2020.  \nDr. Manvir Singh just graduated with a\
  \ PhD in human evolutionary biology from Harvard University, with a focus on cognitive\
  \ and evolutionary anthropology. His research program aims to explain why societies\
  \ develop complex, recurrent traditions such as shamanism, witchcraft, origin myths,\
  \ property rights, sharing norms, lullabies, dance, music, and gods, as these have\
  \ appeared in all types of societies across the globe, from nomadic hunter-gatherer\
  \ bands to complex, industrial, mega-urbanized states.\n\nIn this episode, we start\
  \ by talking about the Mentawai people from Indonesia, and the aspects of their\
  \ sociality that Dr. Singh has focused his work the most on. One of those aspects\
  \ refers to the fact that they have small, but moralizing, gods. Other topics include\
  \ shamanism, witchcraft, sorcery, and religious self-denial. We also mention the\
  \ role that self-interest plays in the design of social rules. Finally, we address\
  \ the topic of music universals, the evolutionary bases of music, and infant-directed\
  \ vocalizations.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:01  The Mentawai people of Siberut Island,\
