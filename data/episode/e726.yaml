shownotes: "<p>Dr. Cristina Moya is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University\
  \ of California, Davis. She is an evolutionary anthropologist interested in how\
  \ humans respond adaptively to culturally structured social worlds. Two main foci\
  \ of her research are: intergroup interactions and social cognition; and cross-cultural\
  \ variation in social effects on reproduction.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk\
  \ about ethnic categories, and social effects on reproduction. We start by defining\
  \ ethnic categories, and we talk about their evolutionary bases; the fact that there\
  \ is no correlation between \u201Crace\u201D and culture; stereotyping, essentialism,\
  \ and ethnocentrism; how people think about ethnic groups; child development; and\
  \ gene-culture coevolution in ethnic psychology. We then get into social effects\
  \ on reproduction, with a focus on the impact of family members. We discuss reproduction\
  \ in industrialized societies; religiosity; and female-dispersing groups, and age\
  \ at menopause. Finally, we talk about potential explanations for the demographic\
  \ transition in industrialized societies.</p>\n"
