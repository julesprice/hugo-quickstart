shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 13th 2023.  \nDr. Marissa Harrison is Associate Professor\
  \ of Psychology in the School of Behavioral Sciences and Education, and Interim\
  \ Chair of Social Sciences and Psychology at Penn State Harrisburg. She is a research\
  \ psychologist who investigates serial murder, and interest in serial murder, from\
  \ an evolutionary and other psychological perspectives. She is the author of Just\
  \ as Deadly: The Psychology of Female Serial Killers.\n\nIn this episode, we focus\
  \ on Just as Deadly. We start by talking about statistics on serial killing, and\
  \ why the focus tends to be on males. We discuss morbid curiosity, and why some\
  \ people are interested in serial killing. We then get into psychological factors,\
  \ like demographic data; development, life events, and trauma; motivations, and\
  \ the modus operandi; neurological data; and sociocultural factors. We talk about\
  \ how commentators in the media might misinform people on crime and criminals. Finally,\
  \ we discuss a possible evolutionary rationale behind female serial killing.\n\n\
