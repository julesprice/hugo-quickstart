shownotes: "<p>Dr. Clara Mattei is an Assistant Professor in the Economics Department\
  \ of The New School for Social Research. Her research contributes to the history\
  \ of capitalism, exploring the critical relation between economic ideas and technocratic\
  \ policy making. She is the author of The Capital Order: How Economists Invented\
  \ Austerity and Paved the Way to Fascism.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on The\
  \ Capital Order. We start by talking about how the relationship between the state\
  \ and the market changed during World War I, and the empowerment of workers in its\
  \ aftermath, illustrating it with the example of wage relations. We discuss workers\
  \ movements and their goals, and the development of austerity in reaction to it.\
  \ We talk about the real goals, and the economic and social consequences of austerity.\
  \ We discuss if there is any \u201Capolitical\u201D theory in economics, and how\
  \ austerity should be viewed as a response, not to economic crises, but to crises\
  \ of capitalism. We also discuss the link between austerity and fascism, and if\
  \ austerity can go away.</p>\n"
