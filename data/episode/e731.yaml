shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 26th 2022.  \nDr. Clara Mattei is an Assistant Professor\
  \ in the Economics Department of The New School for Social Research, and was a 2018-2019\
  \ member of the School of Social Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Studies.\
  \ Her research contributes to the history of capitalism, exploring the critical\
  \ relation between economic ideas and technocratic policy making. She is the author\
  \ of The Capital Order: How Economists Invented Austerity and Paved the Way to Fascism.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on The Capital Order. We start by talking about how\
  \ the relationship between the state and the market changed during World War I,\
  \ and the empowerment of workers in its aftermath, illustrating it with the example\
  \ of wage relations. We discuss workers movements and their goals, and the development\
  \ of austerity in reaction to it. We talk about the real goals, and the economic\
  \ and social consequences of austerity. We discuss if there is any \u201Capolitical\u201D\
  \ theory in economics, and how austerity should be viewed as a response, not to\
  \ economic crises, but to crises of capitalism. We also talk about the link between\
  \ austerity and fascism, and finally we discuss if austerity can go away.\n\nTime\
