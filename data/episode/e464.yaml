shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 4th 2021.  \nDr. Brent W. Roberts is a Professor\
  \ of Psychology and Director of the Center for Social and Behavioral Science at\
  \ the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Dr. Roberts's research has focused\
  \ on determining the replicable patterns of continuity and change in personality\
  \ traits across adulthood, the life experiences associated with changes in personality\
  \ traits over time, and the significance of these changes for individual functioning.\
  \ Dr. Roberts also conducts research on psychometric issues, in particular how to\
  \ measure the traits of conscientiousness and narcissism, and more recently, how\
  \ to best assess socio-emotional skills.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about personality\
  \ psychology. We discuss models of personality traits; continuity and change in\
  \ personality traits across the lifespan; if old people can change their personality;\
  \ potential individual differences in personality malleability; how culture influences\
  \ personality; personality and social roles; gender differences in personality;\
  \ conscientiousness and life outcomes; and narcissism.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
