shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 21st 2021.  \nDr. Karen Kramer is Professor of Anthropology\
  \ at the University of Utah. Her research interests span behavioral ecology, demography,\
  \ comparative life history and reproductive ecology, the evolution of juvenility,\
  \ cooperative breeding, intergenerational transfers and the interaction between\
  \ economic and demographic transitions. The question that unifies her research is\
  \ why do humans have the unparalleled capacity for population growth compared to\
  \ closely related species? Her field work in a traditional Maya village in the Yucatan,\
  \ Mexico has focused on documenting and modeling children\u2019s time allocation,\
  \ juvenile cooperation, intergenerational resource flows, female energetics, and\
  \ high fertility in a pretransitional population. Her research among the Pum\xE9\
  , a group of South American mobile hunter-gatherers addresses questions about children\u2019\
  s growth, development and reproductive strategies, and the effects that seasonal\
  \ resource availability has on fertility and child mortality. She also collaborates\
  \ with conservation biologists and primatologists working in the Madagascar highlands.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about human life history; cooperative breeding; human\
  \ parenting; parental investment; female energetics and fertility and child-rearing;\
  \ teen motherhood in traditional societies; Dr. Kramer\u2019s work on the Pum\xE9\
  \ from Venezuela and Maya villages in Mexico, and what she learned from them; what\
  \ drives population growth in human societies; how sex ratios influence dispersal\
  \ patterns and family formation; and mating systems.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro\
