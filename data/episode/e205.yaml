  \ Professor in the Center for Ethics and Humanities in the Life Sciences and the\
  \ Department of Translational Science &amp; Molecular Medicine at Michigan State\
  \ University. Dr. Cabrera's interests focus on the ethical and societal implications\
  \ of neurotechnology and neuroscientific advances. She has been working on projects\
  \ that explore the media coverage and the attitudes of the general public toward\
  \ pharmacological and novel neurosurgical interventions for the treatment of psychiatric\
  \ disorders. She has also worked on the public perceptions towards the use of different\
  \ modalities of neuromodifiers for enhancement purposes, as well as their normative\
  \ implications. Her current work focuses on the ethical and social implications\
  \ of environmental changes for brain and mental health. She\u2019s also the author\
  \ of the book Rethinking Human Enhancement: Social Enhancement and Emergent Technologies.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we discuss human enhancement from a philosophical perspective.\
  \ We talk about the difficulty in defining \u201Cenhancement\u201D, and also about\
  \ the three paradigms of human enhancement, as defined by Dr. Cabrera in her book,\
  \ Rethinking Human Enhancement: the biomedical, the transhumanist, and the social.</p>\n\
