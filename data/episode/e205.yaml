  \ Humanities in the Life Sciences and the Department of Translational Science &\
  \ Molecular Medicine at Michigan State University. Dr. Cabrera's interests focus\
  \ on the ethical and societal implications of neurotechnology and neuroscientific\
  \ advances. She has been working on projects that explore the media coverage and\
  \ the attitudes of the general public toward pharmacological and novel neurosurgical\
  \ interventions for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. She has also worked\
  \ on the public perceptions towards the use of different modalities of neuromodifiers\
  \ for enhancement purposes, as well as their normative implications. Her current\
  \ work focuses on the ethical and social implications of environmental changes for\
  \ brain and mental health. She\u2019s also the author of the book Rethinking Human\
  \ Enhancement: Social Enhancement and Emergent Technologies.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we discuss human enhancement from a philosophical perspective. We talk about the\
  \ difficulty in defining \u201Cenhancement\u201D, and also about the three paradigms\
  \ of human enhancement, as defined by Dr. Cabrera in her book, Rethinking Human\
  \ Enhancement: the biomedical, the transhumanist, and the social.\n\nTime Links:\
