shownotes: "Dr. Miguel Farias is an Associate Professor at Coventry University, UK.\
  \ His work explores the psychological impact of beliefs and spiritual practices,\
  \ including meditation and pilgrimage. He is also interested in the biological roots\
  \ of our beliefs and how we can change them. He\u2019s the author of The Buddha\
  \ Pill: Can Meditation Change You?.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on some of the\
  \ main topics in Dr. Farias\u2019 book, The Buddha Pill. We go through some of the\
  \ main issues in the psychological research on the effects of yoga, meditation and\
  \ mindfulness. We talk about studies done on inmates, and the relationship between\
  \ meditation and violence, linking it to ritual and synchrony. Finally, we talk\
  \ about the literature on the relationship between religious beliefs and stress\
  \ and anxiety-reduction, and how people use all sorts of strategies to give meaning\
  \ to their lives, including atheists and agnostics.  \n\nTime Links:  \n00:49  Issues\
