shownotes: "<p>Dr. Miguel Farias is a Associate Professor at Coventry University,\
  \ UK. His work explores the psychological impact of beliefs and spiritual practices,\
  \ including meditation and pilgrimage. He is also interested in the biological roots\
  \ of our beliefs and how we can change them. He\u2019s the author of The Buddha\
  \ Pill: Can Meditation Change You?.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on some of\
  \ the main topics in Dr. Farias\u2019 book, The Buddha Pill. We go through some\
  \ of the main issues in the psychological research on the effects of yoga, meditation\
  \ and mindfulness. We talk about studies done on inmates, and the relationship between\
  \ meditation and violence, linking it to ritual and synchrony. Finally, we talk\
  \ about the literature on the relationship between religious beliefs and stress\
  \ and anxiety-reduction, and how people use all sorts of strategies to give meaning\
  \ to their lives, including atheists and agnostics. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow\
