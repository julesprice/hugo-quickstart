shownotes: "Dr. Michael Muthukrishna is an Assistant Professor of Economic Psychology\
  \ at the London School of Economics. His other affiliations include Research Associate\
  \ of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University, Affiliate\
  \ of the Developmental Economics Group at STICERD, and Technical Director of The\
  \ Database of Religious History. His research focuses on the psychological and evolutionary\
  \ processes that underlie culture and how culture is transmitted, maintained, and\
  \ modified. He\u2019s interested in better understanding the dynamic relationship\
  \ between \u201Ccultures\u201D and individuals, where cultures emerge from the interactions\
  \ of individuals over time, who are in turn shaped by the emergent cultures they\
  \ constitute. He\u2019s particularly interested in the application of research in\
  \ cultural evolution to public policy.\n\nIn this episode, we first talk about the\
  \ interplay between biology and culture in explaining large-scale human cooperation,\
  \ and the biological bases of human culture. We then refer to the Cultural Brain\
  \ Hypothesis, the relationship between individual-level psychology and group-level\
  \ traits, genetic and cultural evolution, and contentious topic of group selection.\
  \ Finally, we talk about prosocial institutions, and political corruption and how\
  \ societies might promote it and also common strategies to fight it that might backfire.\n\
