shownotes: "<p>Dr. Sabine N\xF6bel is a Postdoc at the Martin-Luther University Halle\
  \ Wittenberg in the group \u201CAnimal Ecology\u201C. Her background is in the behavioral\
  \ ecology of Poeciliids and Drosophila studying non-genetic inheritance of mating\
  \ preferences using mate-copying, by which females build mating preferences by observing\
  \ and copying conspecific females\u2019 mate-choice. She studies how new, socially\
  \ learnt mating preferences can invade a population and persist across generations.\
  \ Dr. N\xF6bel is the secretary of ESLR (Association of Early-career Social Learning\
  \ Researchers) Society.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about social\
  \ learning, mate copying, and culture. We start by discussing social learning from\
  \ an evolutionary perspective. We get into the specific example of mate copying,\
  \ and how it occurs in Drosophila. We get into the factors that play a role in it;\
  \ if rejections are also copied; and how choosers can deceive the copiers. We then\
  \ talk about social learning, culture, conformity, and traditions in non-human animals,\
  \ and how to understand culture from a biological perspective. We discuss if mate\
  \ copying can have implications for the study of evolved mate preferences, and sexual\
  \ selection. Finally, we discuss if by studying culture and cultural transmission\
  \ in non-human animals can we get new insights into human culture.</p>\n"
