  of Psychological &amp; Brain Sciences at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Krupenye
  is interested in the cognitive abilities of humans and other species, especially
  those involved in navigating the social world.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about aspects of primate sociality. We start with theory
  of mind, and discuss if it is a unitary capacity, and how to study it in nonhuman
  primates. We ask if other primates have theory of mind, and talk about studying
  self and self-awareness. We also get into understanding false beliefs, sharing behavior,
  prosociality, and a preference for helpers or hinderers.</p>
