shownotes: "<p>But I am still going through hard times. &nbsp;I really do hope this\
  \ is the last time I have to ask for your help. In order to sustain the channel,\
  \ and even to support myself and my girlfriend I need your help. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>My\
  \ girlfriend has just lost her job, and I will be needing to fully support her and\
  \ myself for whatever amount of time needed, until things get better. &nbsp;&nbsp;I\
  \ am trying to get another job to complement what I am getting from the channel,\
  \ but you certainly now that that is extremely difficult at the moment, due to the\
  \ impact coronavirus is having on the economy across the globe. I am going to try\
  \ my very best, but I am desperate. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you appreciate what I am doing,\
  \ and have some money you could spare, please help me! &nbsp;</p>\n<p>For these\
  \ past two years, I have brought on the show some of the top academics/scholars\
  \ in a diversity of fields, like Psychology, Anthropology, Cognitive Science, Neuroscience,\
  \ Philosophy, and even Literary Studies. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>On my show, you can certainly\
  \ find informative, well-researched, engaging, and fun interviews on topics that\
  \ will feed your intellectual interest. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>My income for these past\
  \ two years has depended completely on the donations made by my charitable patrons\
  \ and Paypal supporters, but, unfortunately, it is not enough. &nbsp;In today\u2019\
  s society, scientific literacy is ever more important, and, hopefully, I have been\
  \ contributing to spread knowledge outside of academia in a format that I try my\
  \ best to be accessible even to laypeople. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So I ask you to\
  \ please consider supporting me on the platforms I will link down below. &nbsp;I\
  \ am leaving a link to my Patreon page and links to monthly subscriptions on Paypal,\
  \ and also a link to Paypal for a one-time big donation, if you prefer, if any of\
  \ you would be generous enough to become a patron or give me a one-time big donation.\
