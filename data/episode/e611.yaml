  \ in Poughkeepsie, New York. Her research addresses various topics in the philosophy\
  \ of mind. She is the author of Possibilities of Perception (Oxford UP, 2013), and\
  \ Why It\u2019s OK to Be of Two Minds.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Why\
  \ It\u2019s Ok to be of Two Minds. We talk about what it means to be of two minds;\
  \ the positive effects of not eliminating the conflict; three different models of\
  \ dealing with the conflict: a juggler model, an isometrics model, and a disruptor\
  \ model; conflicts with past and future selves; when projecting fantasy into reality\
  \ might become a problem; dealing with inner conflicts through laughter and surrealism;\
  \ when being of two minds is a problem; and what philosophers might gain from being\
  \ have to hold opposing views in their minds.</p>\n"
