  \ and Vices of the Modern Economy.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Capitalism\
  \ for Realists. We start by defining capitalism, and talk about people\u2019s current\
  \ views on capitalism and socialism. We discuss what Marx got wrong about capitalism,\
  \ and Dr. Rutar\u2019s approach. We talk about different explanations for the origins\
  \ of capitalism, from Weber, Henrich, and Mokyr; and an alternative explanation\
  \ for its development in 15th and 16th-century England. We get into topics like\
  \ market exploitation and the minimum wage; the relationship between capitalism\
  \ and poverty; economic inequality; the term \u201Cneoliberalism\u201D; and claims\
  \ about the morality of markets. Finally, we talk about climate change.</p>\n"
