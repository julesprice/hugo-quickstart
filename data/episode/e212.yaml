shownotes: "Dr. Donald Hoffman is a Professor in the Department of Cognitive Sciences\
  \ at the University of California, Irvine. Dr. Hoffman studies consciousness, visual\
  \ perception and evolutionary psychology using mathematical models and psychophysical\
  \ experiments. His research subjects include facial attractiveness, the recognition\
  \ of shape, the perception of motion and color, the evolution of perception, and\
  \ the mind-body problem. He has co-authored two technical books: Observer Mechanics:\
  \ A Formal Theory of Perception, and Automotive Lighting and Human Vision. He is\
  \ just about to release a new book, The Case Against Reality: Why Evolution Hid\
  \ the Truth from Our Eyes.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about how perception (particularly\
  \ visual perception) works, how it has evolved, and the implications that has to\
  \ how we deal with \u201Cobjective reality\u201D. First, Dr. Hoffman explains how\
  \ he studies the architecture of vision. We discuss the evolutionary rationale behind\
  \ perception, or how it has evolved \u2013 the interface theory of perception. In\
  \ the second part, we go a little bit metaphysical, and discuss what is reality,\
  \ and the role that consciousness plays in it. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:45  How vision\
