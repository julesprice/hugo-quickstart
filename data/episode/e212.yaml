shownotes: "<p>Dr. Donald Hoffman is a Professor in the Department of Cognitive Sciences\
  \ at the University of California, Irvine. Dr. Hoffman studies consciousness, visual\
  \ perception and evolutionary psychology using mathematical models and psychophysical\
  \ experiments. His research subjects include facial attractiveness, the recognition\
  \ of shape, the perception of motion and color, the evolution of perception, and\
  \ the mind-body problem. He has co-authored two technical books: Observer Mechanics:\
  \ A Formal Theory of Perception, and Automotive Lighting and Human Vision. He is\
  \ just about to release a new book, The Case Against Reality: Why Evolution Hid\
  \ the Truth from Our Eyes.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about how perception\
  \ (particularly visual perception) works, how it has evolved, and the implications\
  \ that has to how we deal with \u201Cobjective reality\u201D. First, Dr. Hoffman\
  \ explains how he studies the architecture of vision. We discuss the evolutionary\
  \ rationale behind perception, or how it has evolved \u2013 the interface theory\
  \ of perception. In the second part, we go a little but metaphysical, and discuss\
  \ what is reality, and the role that consciousness plays in it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
