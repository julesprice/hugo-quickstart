shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 10th 2023.  \nDr. Jana Gallus is Associate Professor of\
  \ Strategy and Behavioral Decision Making at UCLA Anderson School of Management.\
  \ Her research interests lie in behavioral economics, strategy, and innovation,\
  \ with a focus on recognition incentives and their effects on decision-making. She\
  \ investigates how incentive schemes can be designed to enhance employee motivation\
  \ and organizational performance in the private, public, and nonprofit sectors.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about the psychology and economics of incentives. We\
  \ start by defining incentives, and their different kinds. We discuss what incentives\
  \ work, and in what contexts, with Alan Fiske\u2019s relational models framework\
  \ in mind. We talk about Dr. Gallus\u2019 work experimenting with incentives at\
  \ Wikipedia, and the role of gender, power, and emotions in the collaborative production\
  \ of knowledge there. We discuss if gendered behavior might be influenced by relative\
  \ social standing. We talk about peer comparison information, how it is used, and\
  \ when it works. Finally, we discuss gender gaps in knowledge contributions in academia,\
  \ and where they stem from.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:45  Incentives,\
