  \ gender, power, and emotions in the collaborative production of knowledge there.\
  \ We discuss if gendered behavior might be influenced by relative social standing.\
  \ We talk about peer comparison information, how it is used, and when it works.\
  \ Finally, we discuss gender gaps in knowledge contributions in academia, and where\
  \ they stem from.</p>\n"
