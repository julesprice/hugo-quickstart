shownotes: "<p>Dr. James Costa is Executive Director of the Highlands Biological Station\
  \ and Professor of Evolutionary Biology at Western Carolina University. He has authored\
  \ 7 books, including Darwin's Backyard: How Small Experiments Led to a Big Theory\
  \ (W. W. Norton, 2017) \u2014 a finalist for the American Association for the Advancement\
  \ of Science/Subaru Prize \u2014 and the co-edited volume An Alfred Russel Wallace\
  \ Companion (Chicago, 2019).</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about Darwin, Wallace,\
  \ On the Origin of Species, and The Descent of Man. We first talk about On the Origin\
  \ of Species, where Darwin\u2019s ideas came from, and in what ways they differ\
  \ from Wallace\u2019s. We then get into The Descent of Man, and go through some\
  \ of the most important topics covered there, including sexual selection, our primate\
  \ origins, the evolutionary origins of our mental faculties, race and sex differences,\
  \ cultural evolution, and (cultural) group selection. We also talk about how Darwin\
  \ was a precursor of evolutionary psychology. We discuss the eusocial insects, and\
  \ if their behavior is best understood as the result of inclusive fitness/kin selection\
  \ or group selection. Finally, we give a summary of some of the most important things\
  \ Darwin got right and wrong.</p>\n"
