  \ Philosophy at the University of Sussex. She has published on aesthetics, fiction,\
  \ imagination, and sexual objectification. She is currently the vice-president of\
  \ the British Society of Aesthetics. In her monograph Only Imagine: Fiction, Interpretation\
  \ and Imagination (2017) she examines the nature of fictional content. She has expressed\
  \ critical views on the UK Gender Recognition Act and trans self-identification.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we start by talking a little bit about the philosophy of fiction,\
  \ and the sorts of topics that are explored there. Then, we establish a bridge with\
  \ the topics of sex, gender and transgenderism, and go through issues about how\
  \ the topic of transgenderism is being dealt with at a political level in Western\
  \ society.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:41  The philosophy of fiction  \n07:20  Sex, gender,\
