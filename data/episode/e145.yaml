  <p>In this episode, we talk about the relationship between evolutionary theory,\
  \ philosophy, ethics and politics. We refer to the role of philosophy in a scientific\
  \ world; the importance of selfishness and altruism in moral philosophy; evolutionary\
  \ processes like kin selection, reciprocal altruism and group selection; how our\
  \ moral values are influences by our personality and other innate proclivities;\
  \ what is mora important for societies; the is-ought dichotomy, and if the naturalistic\
  \ fallacy really exists; and also about the work of Friedrich Hayek, Karl Polanyi,\
  \ and the positive aspects and limitations of market liberal morality, both at the\
  \ individual and collective levels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>01:32 How\
