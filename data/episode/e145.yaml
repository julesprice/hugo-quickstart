shownotes: "Dr. Filipe Nobre Faria currently works as a post-doctoral researcher in\
  \ ethics and political philosophy at the Institute for Philosophy of the Nova University\
  \ of Lisbon (IFILNOVA). Furthermore, he lectures on subjects of his expertise at\
  \ the Faculty of Social and Human Sciences/Nova. Previously, he earned his PhD in\
  \ Political Theory (2016) from King\u2019s College London and his master degree\
  \ in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (2011) from the University of East Anglia.\
  \ He also taught within the areas of political theory and political economy at King\u2019\
  s College London. His main research interest lies in applying the insights of the\
  \ behavioural and evolutionary sciences to issues in social and political philosophy.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about the relationship between evolutionary theory, philosophy,\
  \ ethics and politics. We refer to the role of philosophy in a scientific world;\
  \ the importance of selfishness and altruism in moral philosophy; evolutionary processes\
  \ like kin selection, reciprocal altruism and group selection; how our moral values\
  \ are influences by our personality and other innate proclivities; what is mora\
  \ important for societies; the is-ought dichotomy, and if the naturalistic fallacy\
  \ really exists; and also about the work of Friedrich Hayek, Karl Polanyi, and the\
  \ positive aspects and limitations of market liberal morality, both at the individual\
  \ and collective levels. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:32  How to apply evolutionary theory\
