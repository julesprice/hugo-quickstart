shownotes: "<p>Dr. Anna Vedel is PhD and Postdoc in the Department of Psychology and\
  \ Behavioural Sciences at Aarhus University, Denmark. Her research areas are in\
  \ individual differences, personality, academic performance, and study choices.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about how personality traits and individual differences\
  \ influence educational, occupational and life choices. First, we discuss current\
  \ personality inventories, particularly the Big Five, and their scientific basis\
  \ and validity. Then, we get into issues related to the gender equality paradox,\
  \ and how the differences between men and women in personality and educational and\
  \ career choices exacerbate in countries that are more gender equal. We talk about\
  \ findings in personality differences across academic majors, and also about the\
  \ personality traits that are the most stable across lifespan, but also the ones\
  \ that change a bit.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Vedel\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty\
