shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 5th 2022.  \nDr. David Benatar is professor of philosophy\
  \ at the University of Cape Town in Cape Town, South Africa. He is best known for\
  \ his advocacy of anti-natalism in his book Better Never to Have Been: The Harm\
  \ of Coming into Existence, in which he argues that coming into existence is a serious\
  \ harm, regardless of the feelings of the existing being once brought into existence,\
  \ and that, as a consequence, it is always morally wrong to create more sentient\
  \ beings. His new book is The Fall of the University of Cape Town: Africa\u2019\
  s Leading University in Decline.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Fall of the\
  \ University of Cape Town. Dr. Benatar gives us a brief overview of how the decline\
  \ at UCT started, how it was dealt with, and the demands made by the students. We\
  \ talk about terms like \u201Ctransformation\u201D and \u201Cdecolonization\u201D\
  \ of the curricula. We discuss the role of university, and academic freedom. We\
  \ talk about racial issues in South Africa, affirmative action, cancel culture,\
  \ and identity politics. Finally, we ask if there are any good solutions to what\
  \ is happening at UCT.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:36  When it all started\
