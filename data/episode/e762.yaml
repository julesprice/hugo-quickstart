shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 12th 2022.  \nDr. Dean Buonomano is Professor of\
  \ Neurobiology and Psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles. His\
  \ research goal is to understand how neurons develop selective responses to temporal\
  \ features such as duration, interval and order. He is the author of Brain Bugs:\
  \ How the Brain's Flaws Shape our Lives, and Your Brain is a Time Machine: The Neuroscience\
  \ and Physics of Time.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the neuroscience of timing.\
  \ We start by discussing how to understand time from the perspective of neuroscience,\
  \ and how the brain processes time. We talk about factors that influence our perception\
  \ of time, when it comes to duration, interval, and order. We discuss the relationship\
  \ between neural time and subjective time, how the brain encodes neural time in\
  \ patterns of neural activity, and if there are brain regions specialized in time\
  \ processing. We talk about the interaction between timing and the sensory systems,\
  \ and timing as an intrinsic property of neural networks. We discuss the relationship\
  \ between neural time and the physical nature of time. Finally, we talk about what\
  \ a mental clock is.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:36  Time from the perspective\
