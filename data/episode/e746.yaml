  <p>In this episode, we talk about autism and sex differences. We first talk about
  autism; what characterizes it; why it is classified as a mental disorder, and the
  idea of neurodiversity; its early signs; and the lower quality of life of autistic
  people. We discuss the systemizing mechanism, and the distinction between systemizing
  and empathizing. We talk about the role of testosterone in intra-uterine development,
  and differences in the brain development of autistic people. &nbsp;We discuss why
  the distinction between cognitive and emotional empathy is important. Finally, we
  talk about sex differences, regions of the brain that might be sexually dimorphic,
  criticisms of the biological bases of sex differences, and we discuss if it is possible
  to distinguish between male and female brains.</p>
