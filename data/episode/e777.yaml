  <p>In this episode, we talk about the evolutionary psychology of humor. We start
  by discussing what humor is. We talk about humor as a product of evolution, and
  its signaling functions. We go through the correlation between humor and intelligence,
  and personality traits. We get into the different humor styles. We discuss how humor
  is contextual, and why it is normal to sometimes feel offended. We talk about the
  psychological traits of professional comedians, and stereotypes people have about
  them. We talk about how people rate their own attempts at humor, and how humor appreciation
  changes across the lifespan. Finally, we discuss sex differences in humor production
  and appreciation, and the different possible explanations for them.</p>
