shownotes: "Dr. David Benatar is professor of philosophy at the University of Cape\
  \ Town in Cape Town, South Africa. He is best known for his advocacy of antinatalism\
  \ in his book Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence, in which\
  \ he argues that coming into existence is a serious harm, regardless of the feelings\
  \ of the existing being once brought into existence, and that, as a consequence,\
  \ it is always morally wrong to create more sentient beings. He\u2019s also the\
  \ author of books like The Second Sexism: Discrimination Against Men and Boys (2012),\
  \ and The Human Predicament: A Candid Guide to Life's Biggest Questions (2017).\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on anti-natalism, and its several ramifications. We\
  \ tackle the asymmetry argument from different angles. We talk about how we are\
  \ predisposed to evaluate life, and if we can do it objectively. We establish a\
  \ distinction between a life worth continuing and a life worth starting. And we\
  \ also go through some specific topics like life for nonhuman animals, abortion,\
  \ suicide, euthanasia, and environmentalism. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:01  The anti-natalist\
