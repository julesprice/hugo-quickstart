shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 14th 2022.  \nDr. Tanisha Fazal is a Professor of\
  \ Political Science at the University of Minnesota. Her research and teaching focus\
  \ on sovereignty, international law, medical care in conflict zones, and armed conflict.\
  \ From 2021\u20132023, she is also an Andrew Carnegie Fellow. She is the author\
  \ of State Death: The Politics and Geography of Conquest, Occupation, and Annexation;\
  \ and Wars of Law: Unintended Consequences in the Regulation of Armed Conflict.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on Wars of Law. We talk about the history of laws of\
  \ war, and particularly declarations of war and peace treaties. We discuss their\
  \ goals, the perverse incentives they introduce, their effects on rates of war initiation,\
  \ who are their framers, and their biases. We talk about how rebel groups engage\
  \ with them, and people that should be included in the future. We discuss several\
  \ problems with Pinker\u2019s decline-of-war thesis. Finally, we ask if laws of\
  \ war disincentivize or try to eliminate war.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n\
