shownotes: "<p>Dr. Michael Bang Petersen is Professor of Political Science at Aarhus\
  \ University, in Denmark. He also directs The Politics and Evolution Lab (PoNE Lab)\
  \ there. He investigates how the adaptive challenges of human evolutionary history\
  \ shape the way modern citizens think about mass politics.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we talk about evolutionary political psychology. We discuss what is to\
  \ be understood as political behavior; the emotions, heuristics and biases that\
  \ are more relevant to understand people\u2019s political behavior (and also in\
  \ other animals); the deservingness heuristic; the biological bases of our progress\
  \ from small-scale hunter-gatherer societies to modern states, and the expansion\
  \ of group identities; the cues that lead people to support the welfare system more\
  \ easily; intentionality; how to tackle issues of political polarization; and also\
  \ the benefits that politicians can take from learning more about evolutionary psychology,\
  \ and how human psychology generally works.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:37 What\
