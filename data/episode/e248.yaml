shownotes: "<p>Dr. Todd Shackelford is a Distinguished Professor and Chair of Psychology\
  \ at Oakland University, as well as the Co-Director of the Evolutionary Psychology\
  \ Lab there. He is the editor in chief of the academic journals Evolutionary Psychology\
  \ and Evolutionary Psychological Science. He is a fellow of the American Psychological\
  \ Association and the Association for Psychological Science.</p>\n<p>Dr. Viviana\
  \ Weekes-Shackelford received her Ph.D. in evolutionary developmental psychology\
  \ in 2011 from Florida Atlantic University. She is currently Visiting Assistant\
  \ Professor in Sociology and Criminal Justice at Oakland University and Co-Director\
  \ of the Evolutionary Psychology Lab. Her research over the years has been evolutionarily\
  \ inspired and has had the broader goal of gaining a more comprehensive understanding\
  \ of violence and conflict in families and romantic relationships. Her research\
  \ interests and record cut across the psychological domains of forensics, development,\
  \ social, personality, clinical, and criminology.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk\
  \ about what happens in people\u2019s mating lives after they have children. We\
  \ talk about the trade-offs people need to make between mating and parenting. We\
  \ refer to how children might get exposed to more violence from step-parents, and\
  \ how women don\u2019t necessarily need men to raise children adequately. We also\
  \ discuss how men tend to be more violent, even toward their own children, and the\
  \ issue of differential investment by paternal and maternal grandparents. We then\
  \ go into the ways having children might affect their parents\u2019 romantic relationship,\
  \ and how there are different outcomes for different couples. We also talk about\
  \ the several ways single parents (both men and women) might see their mate value\
  \ decrease. Toward the end we also speculate a bit, and discuss why children probably\
  \ don\u2019t interfere with their parents having more children, and why witnessing\
  \ their parents having sex and seeing naked people probably does not have a negative\
  \ impact on children.</p>\n"
