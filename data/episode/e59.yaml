  \ episode, the conversation revolves around sexual selection in primate species,\
  \ and human universals and the contributions of primatology to a better understanding\
  \ of human behavior. Starting with the conditions to lead to the development of\
  \ sexual dimorphisms, we then move on to talk about intersexual and intrasexual\
  \ selection; the ecological conditions that favor male and female philopatry, that\
  \ is, for males or females to stay in their troops of origin; pair-bonding in animals,\
  \ and the problem with explaining monogamy; how sex ratios influence reproductive\
  \ strategies; life history, and what it tells us about the evolutionary history\
  \ of a particular species; primatology and the study of human universals; the relevance\
  \ of the unique events in Homo sapiens\u2019 evolutionary history; and also the\
  \ studying of other animal taxa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:47 How sexual\
