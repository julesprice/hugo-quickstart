shownotes: "<p>Dr. Sarah Hill is Associate Professor of Psychology at Texas Christian\
  \ University. She studies a range of topics, applying an evolutionary lens, including\
  \ the interplay between immune function and mating strategies; the impact of inflammation;\
  \ poverty, food regulation, and weight gain; hormonal contraceptives and mate choice;\
  \ and other topics under the rubric of life history theory.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we talk about life history theory; how life history varies between species, and\
  \ also how environmental cues might trigger fast or slow life history strategies.\
  \ We talk about how it all starts in the uterus; the environmental cues people pay\
  \ more attention to; how personality and other psychological traits might produce\
  \ individual variation in dealing with the same cues. The we get into specific topics,\
  \ like immune function; age of puberty onset; inflammation; eating habits and weight\
  \ gain; how contraceptives affect women\u2019s mating strategies; and also how technology\
  \ like online porn, dating websites, and sex robots might tweak men\u2019s mating\
  \ strategies toward preferring short-term relationships.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n\
