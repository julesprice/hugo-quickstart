shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 13th 2023.  \nDr. Coralie Chevallier is a Researcher\
  \ in the evolution and social cognition group, at the Cognitive Science Department\
  \ of the \xC9cole Normale Superieure \u2013 PSL. She is a behavioral scientist studying\
  \ the evolutionary and cognitive determinants of social cognition. She has mainly\
  \ focused on the way motivational factors affect people\u2019s social behaviors.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about individual differences in social cognition. We\
  \ start by discussing what they are, and how they are studied, including behavioral\
  \ tasks and surveys. We discuss how statistical \u201Cnoise\u201D can be meaningful.\
  \ We talk about the psychological effects of living in harsh and unpredictable environments\
  \ in the domains of cooperation and trust, health issues, political attitudes, and\
  \ parental investment. We discuss how we can reframe the way we think about the\
  \ psychology and behavior of people living in harsh environments. We talk about\
  \ how cognitive science can contribute to climate change mitigation. Finally, we\
  \ discuss what studying social cognition can teach us about reducing inequalities\
  \ in higher education.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:56  Individual differences\
