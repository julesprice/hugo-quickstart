shownotes: "<p>Dr. Christian B. Miller is the A. C. Reid Professor of Philosophy at\
  \ Wake Forest University. His research is primarily in contemporary ethics and philosophy\
  \ of religion. He\u2019s the author of several books, the most recent one being\
  \ Honesty: The Philosophy and Psychology of a Neglected Virtue.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we focus on Honesty. We start by discussing what makes something a virtue,\
  \ and what honesty is. We talk about behaviors that are incompatible with honesty,\
  \ with a focus on lying, cheating, and stealing. We also talk about cases where\
  \ there is conflict with other moral values. We discuss who counts as an honest\
  \ person, and we get into contextual factors and intentionality. We refer to the\
  \ particular cases of promise-making, and omission. We ask if one can be too honest.\
  \ We go through some psychological studies on honesty, environmental factors, and\
  \ possible interventions to promote it. Finally, we discuss if the virtues have\
  \ been neglected in Philosophy.</p>\n"
