  \ HOPE YOU ENJOY IT.\n\nDr. Peter Richerson is Distinguished Professor Emeritus\
  \ of the Department of Environmental Science and Policy at the University of California,\
  \ Davis. He\u2019s a biologist with interest in cultural evolution, animal social\
  \ learning and mathematical models. He\u2019s also the author of books like Culture\
  \ and the Evolutionary Process, Not by Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human\
  \ Evolution, and The Origin and Evolution of Cultures, all written in collaboration\
  \ with Dr. Robert Boyd.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about culture, cultural evolution,\
  \ and gene-culture coevolution. We start off with a definition of culture and the\
  \ relationship between biology and culture. Then, we talk about culture as a phenotype,\
  \ how culture evolved, and the cognitive bases of it. We go through some of the\
  \ main scientific approaches to culture and their drawbacks, including Leda Cosmides\
  \ and John Tooby\u2019s evoked culture, the sociobiologists and inclusive fitness,\
  \ and Richard Dawkins\u2019 memetics. We also refer to gene-culture coevolution,\
  \ and how group selection work are the cultural and genetic levels.\n\nTime Links:\
