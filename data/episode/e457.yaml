shownotes: '<p>Dr. Michael Strevens is Professor of Philosophy at New York University.
  He works on the philosophy of science, where his interests include explanation,
  complex systems, probability, confirmation, the social structure of science, and
  causation; the psychology of concepts; and the philosophical applications of cognitive
  science. He is the author of The Knowledge Machine: How Irrationality Created Modern
  Science.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on The Knowledge Machine. We first talk about science
  before the scientific revolution, and what is the scientific method. We discuss
  the ways Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn thought about science. We discuss the central
  thesis of the book, that science is based on irrationality. We also discuss how
  people decide how to interpret scientific data. We talk about the importance of
  replication and peer-review. We ask if science is counterintuitive. Finally, we
  talk about the relationship between philosophy and science, and we ask if science
  can be (morally) prescriptive.</p>
