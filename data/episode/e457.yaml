shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 1st 2021.  \nDr. Michael Strevens is Professor of\
  \ Philosophy at New York University. He works on the philosophy of science, where\
  \ his interests include explanation, complex systems, probability, confirmation,\
  \ the social structure of science, and causation; the psychology of concepts; and\
  \ the philosophical applications of cognitive science. He is the author of The Knowledge\
  \ Machine: How Irrationality Created Modern Science.\n\nIn this episode, we focus\
  \ on The Knowledge Machine. We first talk about science before the scientific revolution,\
  \ and what is the scientific method. We discuss the ways Karl Popper and Thomas\
  \ Kuhn thought about science. We discuss the central thesis of the book, that science\
  \ is based on irrationality. We also discuss how people decide how to interpret\
  \ scientific data. We talk about the importance of replication and peer-review.\
  \ We ask if science is counterintuitive. Finally, we talk about the relationship\
  \ between philosophy and science, and we ask if science can be (morally) prescriptive.\n\
