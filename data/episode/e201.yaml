  \ \n\nIn this episode, we discuss things related to our notion of \u201Cself\u201D\
  , how we construct it, and how we move in our social environments, deal with other\
  \ people, and react to social exclusion. We deal with sociometer theory, and mental\
  \ mechanisms like self-presentation, self-compassion, self-reflection, and their\
  \ relationship with academic success and other life outcomes.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
