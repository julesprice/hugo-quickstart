shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 31st 2020.  \nDr. Virgil Zeigler-Hill is Professor\
  \ of Psychology and Director of Graduate Training at Oakland University. He is a\
  \ social-personality psychologist with primary research interests in four interrelated\
  \ areas: (1) self-esteem, (2) narcissism, (3) cognitive representations of the self,\
  \ and (4) interpersonal relationships. His research concerning self-esteem has largely\
  \ focused on the potential causes and consequences of fragile high self-esteem.\
  \ More recently, his research in this area has led to the development of the status-signaling\
  \ model of self-esteem. His research concerning narcissism has examined the feelings\
  \ of self-worth possessed by individuals with narcissistic personality features.\
  \ His work in the area of cognitive representations of the self has examined the\
  \ association between features of the self-concept (i.e., content and structure)\
  \ and psychological adjustment. Finally, in the area of interpersonal relationships,\
  \ he examines how beliefs about the self and one\u2019s partner influence intimacy,\
  \ relationship satisfaction, and longevity in close relationships.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about the self, self-esteem \u2013 including the status-signaling model\
  \ of self-esteem -, romantic love styles, narcissism, psychological adjustment,\
  \ and the relationship between narcissism and self-esteem and psychopatology.\n\n\
