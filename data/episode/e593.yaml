  <p>In this episode, we focus on On the Origin of Stories. We first talk about the
  evolutionary origins of art and storytelling, including questions like the functions
  of art; if it is an adaptation; sexual selection; and the savannah hypothesis. We
  then get into storytelling, and how we study it in hunter-gatherer societies; universals
  in storytelling; and comparing oral storytelling to literature. We discuss how people
  develop their artistic preferences, and what makes art successful. We compare art
  to other human activities, like religion, and ask if it is special. We discuss the
  role storytelling plays in child development. We address the concern that the quality
  of art might be on the decline. Finally, we talk about what an evolutionary lens
  brings to literary studies.</p>
