shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 17th 2021.  \nDr. Brian Boyd is a University Distinguished\
  \ Professor in the Department of English at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.\
  \ He is known primarily as an expert on the life and works of author Vladimir Nabokov\
  \ and on literature and evolution. He is the author of On the Origin of Stories:\
  \ Evolution, Cognition, and Fiction. \n\nIn this episode, we focus on On the Origin\
  \ of Stories. We first talk about the evolutionary origins of art and storytelling,\
  \ including questions like the functions of art; if it is an adaptation; sexual\
  \ selection; and the savannah hypothesis. We then get into storytelling, and how\
  \ we study it in hunter-gatherer societies; universals in storytelling; and comparing\
  \ oral storytelling to literature. We discuss how people develop their artistic\
  \ preferences, and what makes art successful. We compare art to other human activities,\
  \ like religion, and ask if it is special. We discuss the role storytelling plays\
  \ in child development. We address the concern that the quality of art might be\
  \ on the decline. Finally, we talk about what an evolutionary lens brings to literary\
  \ studies.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:36  The evolutionary origins of art\
