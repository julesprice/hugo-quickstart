shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 13th 2020.  \nDr. Stephen Stearns is Edward P Bass\
  \ Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and Director of Undergraduate Studies\
  \ at Yale University. Dr. Stearns specializes in life history evolution, which links\
  \ the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology, and in evolutionary medicine.\
  \ His books include \u201CEvolutionary Medicine\u201D (Sinauer, 2015) with Ruslan\
  \ Medzhitov, \u201CEvolution, an introduction\u201D (Oxford, 2000, 2nd Ed 2005)\
  \ with Rolf Hoekstra, \u201CWatching, from the Edge of Extinction\u201D (Yale, 1999)\
  \ with his wife Beverly Peterson Stearns, \u201CThe Evolution of Life Histories\u201D\
  \ (Oxford, 1992), and two edited volumes, \u201CEvolution in health and disease\u201D\
  \ (Oxford, 1998, 2nd Ed 2008) and \u201CThe Evolution of Sex and its Consequences.\u201D\
  \n\nIn this episode, we talk about life history theory, and evolutionary medicine.\
  \ We discuss life history theory extensively, including how it links ecology to\
  \ evolutionary biology, and r/K-selection. We talk about individual variation in\
  \ life history strategies, phenotypic plasticity, and culture. We then get into\
  \ evolutionary medicine, where we talk about evolutionary mismatch and diseases\
  \ of the modern world, and evolutionary public health. We end with a question from\
  \ a patron.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:38  Life history theory, and how it connects ecology\
