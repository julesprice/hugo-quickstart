  \ about life history theory, and evolutionary medicine. We discuss life history\
  \ theory extensively, including how it links ecology to evolutionary biology, and\
  \ r/K-selection. We talk about individual variation in life history strategies,\
  \ phenotypic plasticity, and culture. We then get into evolutionary medicine, where\
  \ we talk about evolutionary mismatch and diseases of the modern world, and evolutionary\
  \ public health. We end with a question from a patron.</p>\n"
