shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 23rd 2021.  \nDr. Kyle Thomas recently received his Ph.D.\
  \ in experimental psychology from Harvard University, where he developed his research\
  \ program on the psychology of common knowledge under his advisor, Steven Pinker.\
  \ He is currently the Chief Scientist at MotiveMetrics, where they turn cutting-edge\
  \ psychological science into software tools that can accurately reveal true motivations\
  \ from publicly available data. In short, they help marketers understand why people\
  \ buy\u2014or don\u2019t\u2014at the click of a button. Software hasn\u2019t eaten\
  \ marketing research yet, but they\u2019re working very hard to change that.\n\n\
  In this episode, we talk about common knowledge. We start with some basic definitions\
  \ of private knowledge, shared knowledge, and common knowledge. We then get into\
  \ some examples of domains where common knowledge applies, like economic games,\
  \ self-conscious emotions, charitable behavior, the bystander effect, and indirect\
  \ speech.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:30  Private knowledge, shared knowledge,\
