shownotes: "<p>Dr. Daniel A. Bell is Dean of the School of Political Science and Public\
  \ Administration at Shandong University. Dr. Bell received the Huilin Prize in 2018.\
  \ He is the author of Just Hierarchy: Why Social Hierarchies Matter in China and\
  \ the Rest of the World.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Just Hierarchy. We\
  \ first discuss what is a hierarchy, and what makes for a just hierarchy. Throughout\
  \ the conservation, we refer to different kinds of hierarchies: relations between\
  \ intimates; relations between citizens; relations between states; relations between\
  \ humans and nonhuman animals; and relations between humans and AI. We talk about\
  \ the progressive conservative perspective to hierarchy presented in the book. We\
  \ discuss the differences between Chinese hierarchy and hierarchies in the West,\
  \ and also how it relates to hierarchies in other Eastern Asian countries. We also\
  \ ask what could be some of the reasons behind China\u2019s international success.\
  \ Finally, we discuss what the West could learn from China.</p>\n"
