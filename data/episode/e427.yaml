shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 25th 2020.\n\nDr. Arthur Glenberg is Professor in\
  \ the Department of Psychology at Arizona State University, an emeritus professor\
  \ at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a member of INICO at the Univeridad\
  \ de Salamanca. He does basic research in cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience\
  \ with a focus on developing theories of embodied cognition in the areas of language,\
  \ education, and social processes. In addition, he and his colleagues at ASU have\
  \ developed an embodied reading comprehension intervention (EMBRACE) for English\
  \ language learning children in the early elementary grades. Dr. Glenberg has authored\
  \ a textbook (in its third edition), an edited volume, and over 100 peer-reviewed\
  \ articles.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about embodied cognition. We start by situating\
  \ embodied cognition historically, and in the broader landscape of cognitive science.\
  \ We talk about how work on AI and animal models can inform embodied cognition.\
  \ We ask where embodied cognition places itself in terms of the nature/nurture debate.\
  \  We then get into more specific questions, about how we go from the body to concepts;\
  \ emotions; mental simulation; simulation, action, perception, and language; mirror\
  \ neurons; unifying explanations at the cognitive, social, and cultural levels;\
  \ and rethinking the teaching of reading, math, and science.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
