shownotes: '<p>Dr. Arthur Glenberg is Professor in the Department of Psychology at
  Arizona State University, an emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
  and a member of INICO at the Univeridad de Salamanca. He does basic research in
  cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience with a focus on developing theories
  of embodied cognition in the areas of language, education, and social processes.
  In addition, he and his colleagues at ASU have developed an embodied reading comprehension
  intervention (EMBRACE) for English language learning children in the early elementary
  grades. Dr. Glenberg has authored a textbook (in its third edition), an edited volume,
  and over 100 peer-reviewed articles.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about embodied cognition. We start by situating embodied
  cognition historically, and in the broader landscape of cognitive science. We talk
  about how work on AI and animal models can inform embodied cognition. We ask where
  embodied cognition places itself in terms of the nature/nurture debate. We then
  get into more specific questions, about how we go from the body to concepts; emotions;
  mental simulation; simulation, action, perception, and language; mirror neurons;
  unifying explanations at the cognitive, social, and cultural levels; and rethinking
  the teaching of reading, math, and science.</p>
