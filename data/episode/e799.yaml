shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 6th 2023.  \nDr. Pasquale Raia is Professor of Paleontology\
  \ and Paleoecology at the University of Naples Federico II. His scientific interests\
  \ concern the evolution and the dynamics of extinction of animal species, and in\
  \ particular the fossils of hominid species. His most notable scientific contributions\
  \ regard evolutionary theories about the evolution of insular species, the complexity\
  \ of organisms, and the dynamics of extinction of hominids.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we start by talking about climate change as a factor in evolution, and what drives\
  \ the extinction of species. We discuss how increased specialization can be a problem.\
  \ We get into how climate change impacted the evolution of hominins. We talk about\
  \ why Neanderthals went extinct and H. sapiens survived, and how similar their cognitive\
  \ ability was. We discuss how H. sapiens was able to increase its habitable area.\
  \ We talk about what drove the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna. Finally, we\
  \ discuss the relationship between morphological integration and functional performance,\
  \ and how it influences evolution.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:51  Climate\
