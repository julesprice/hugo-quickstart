shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 16th 2021.  \nDr. Jeremy DeSilva is an Associate Professor\
  \ of Anthropology at Dartmouth College. He is a paleoanthropologist, specializing\
  \ in the locomotion of the first apes (hominoids) and early human ancestors (hominins).\
  \ His particular anatomical expertise-- the human foot and ankle-- has contributed\
  \ to our understanding of the origins and evolution of upright walking in the human\
  \ lineage.  He has studied wild chimpanzees in Western Uganda and early human fossils\
  \ in Museums throughout Eastern and South Africa. From 1998-2003, Dr. DeSilva worked\
  \ as an educator at the Boston Museum of Science and continues to be passionate\
  \ about science education. He is the author of A Most Interesting Problem: What\
  \ Darwin\u2019s Descent of Man Got Right and Wrong about Human Evolution.\n\nThis\
  \ interview is part of the series on the 150th anniversary of Darwin\u2019s Descent\
  \ of Man. \n\nIn this episode, we focus on A Most Interesting Problem, and Darwin\u2019\
  s Descend of Man. We first discuss the Descent of Man in its historical context,\
  \ and compare it to the Origin of Species, and try to trace back the origins of\
  \ some of its most prominent ideas. We talk about part 1 of the book, and the evolutionary\
  \ origins of our mental faculties, and what Darwin had to say about race and sex\
  \ differences. We get into Darwin\u2019s insights on our African origins, and some\
  \ of the most important ideas in the field of paleoanthropology. We explain why\
  \ \u201Crace\u201D is not a useful scientific concept, and why \u201Ccline\u201D\
  \ is a much better one to understand human biodiversity. We also talk about how\
  \ revolutionary the idea of sexual selection was. Finally, we discuss why some of\
  \ Darwin\u2019s ideas were/are problematic, with a focus on a recent controversy\
  \ involving Agust\xEDn Fuentes\u2019 essay on Science, and we sum things up with\
  \ what Darwin got right and wrong about human evolution.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
