shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 3rd 2022.  \nDr. Dorothea Debus is Professor of Theoretical\
  \ Philosophy at Konstanz University, with a special focus on the philosophy of language\
  \ and the philosophy of mind. Her main area of research is the Philosophy of Mind.\
  \ A substantial part of her published work is concerned with the mental phenomenon\
  \ of memory; but she has also written on various other mental phenomena \u2013 imagination,\
  \ attention, perception and the emotions. More recently her research has focused\
  \ on a more general feature of our mental lives, namely the fact that we sometimes\
  \ can be, and often also are, actively involved with how our own mental lives develop;\
  \ she asks how we might possibly account for this ability, and explore its axiological\
  \ implications.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about philosophy of memory, and mental\
  \ self-regulation. We start with a brief introduction to the questions explored\
  \ in philosophy of mind and, more specifically, in the philosophy of memory. We\
  \ get specifically into how we remember the past; the cognitive differences between\
  \ remembering the past and imagining the future; how we understand the concept of\
  \ the past; the causal theory of memory; and past-directed emotions, their role\
  \ and epistemic value. We also discuss mental self-regulation.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
