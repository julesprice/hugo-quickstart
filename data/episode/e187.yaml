shownotes: "<p>Dr. Robert Trivers is an American evolutionary biologist and sociobiologist.\
  \ He proposed the theories of reciprocal altruism (1971), parental investment (1972),\
  \ facultative sex ratio determination (1973), and parent\u2013offspring conflict\
  \ (1974). He has also contributed by explaining self-deception as an adaptive evolutionary\
  \ strategy (first described in 1976) and discussing intragenomic conflict. Steven\
  \ Pinker considers Dr. Trivers to be \"one of the great thinkers in the history\
  \ of Western thought\". He\u2019s also the author of books like Social Evolution\
  \ (1985), Genes in Conflict: The Biology of Selfish Genetic Elements (2006), Deceit\
  \ and Self-Deception: Fooling Yourself the Better to Fool Others (2011), and Wild\
  \ Life: Adventures of an Evolutionary Biologist (2015).</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we talk about all of the major contributions of Dr. Trivers\u2019 to the field\
  \ of Evolutionary Biology. First, we look through the some of the major advancements\
  \ in Evolutionary Biology since Darwin, particularly kin selection, inclusive fitness\
  \ theory, and sexual selection. Dr. Trivers tells us about how we arrived at his\
  \ theories of parental investment, reciprocal altruism and parent-offspring conflict.\
  \ We explore parental investment in its several dimensions and implications. Then,\
  \ we discuss parent-offspring conflict and the many ways it can manifest across\
  \ species. We also refer to reciprocal altruism and the situations where friends\
  \ can be more aligned with our interests than our own family. After that, we talk\
  \ about deceit and self-deception, how they work, and some of the domains where\
  \ they might have the biggest impact. We briefly discuss the modularity of mind\
  \ approach. Finally, Dr. Trivers comments on group selection, and I also ask him\
  \ to tell us about his more recent work on the evolutionary bases of honor killings\
  \ in humans societies.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Trivers\u2019 work:</p>\n<p>Website:\
