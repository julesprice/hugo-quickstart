shownotes: "Dr. Robert A. Burton graduated from Yale University and the University\
  \ of California at San Francisco medical school, where he also completed his neurology\
  \ residency. At age thirty-three, he was appointed chief of the Division of Neurology\
  \ at UCSF Medical Center at Mt. Zion, where he subsequently became Associate Chief\
  \ of the Department of Neurosciences. His books include On Being Certain: Believing\
  \ You Are Right Even When You're Not, A Skeptic's Guide to the Mind; What Neuroscience\
  \ Can and Cannot Tell Us About Ourselves, and three critically acclaimed novels.\
  \ He has also written essays, book reviews and op-ed pieces for the New York Times,\
  \ Salon.com, Aeon, and Nautilus.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on some of the main\
  \ topics of Dr. Burton\u2019s books. We talk about the feelings of knowing, certainty,\
  \ familiarity, clarity of thought, and d\xE9j\xE0 vu that we have. We also refer\
  \ to phenomena like moral dumbfounding and post-hoc rationalization. We discuss\
  \ the problem with our view of how reason and rationality work, and how we are mistaken\
  \ about how our own thinking works. We also talk about how different people see\
  \ the world in different ways, our individual differences, and how religiosity is\
  \ not going away anytime soon. We refer to the placebo effect, and also to how scientists\
  \ have to be careful about how their own intuitions might affect how they study\
  \ the human mind. We end up by discussing a possible way to improve the way we think,\
  \ through a process of cultural evolution.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:07  Feelings of\
  \ knowing and certainty  \n04:54  Do we already know where are they located in the\

  13:08  The problem of how we talk about our minds  \n15:07  Post-hoc rationalizations\
  \  \n20:08  We don\u2019t even understand how we think  \n22:43  The problem with\
  \ how we tend to think about reason and rationality  \n28:48  We see the world in\
  \ different ways  \n38:02  The placebo effect  \n41:42  Researchers also have to\
  \ be careful about their own biases when studying the human mind  \n47:56  A possible\
