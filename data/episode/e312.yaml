  <p>In this episode, we dig into the main topics of his book, Humans and Robots.\
  \ We refer to the fact that there are different kinds of robots and how we should\
  \ deal with them. We talk about anthropomorphization, and the intuitions people\
  \ have about robots\u2019 minds. We raise the question about the ay we treat robots\
  \ spilling into how we treat other humans. We address agency and moral responsibility\
  \ in the context of self-driving cars and military robots. We ask if we can establish\
  \ proper relationships with other robots. Finally, we go through what kinds of minds\
  \ robots can have and what that would mean, and also if robots can also me moral\
  \ agents and be \u201Cgood\u201D.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Nyholm\u2019s work:</p>\n\
