shownotes: "<p>In this episode, we talk about The Epistemic Innocence of Irrational\
  \ Beliefs. We start with some basic concepts, like \u201Cirrational beliefs\u201D\
  , \u201Cepistemic irrationality\u201D, \u201Cepistemics functionality\u201D, and\
  \ \u201Cepistemic innocence\u201D, and we apply them to a philosophical and scientific\
  \ context. We go through some examples where epistemic innocence applies, like self-narratives,\
  \ optimism and pessimism, mental disorders, romantic relationships, and religious\
  \ beliefs. Finally, we discuss how the epistemic innocence project might apply in\
  \ a clinical context, and in understanding how our normal cognition works.</p>\n"
