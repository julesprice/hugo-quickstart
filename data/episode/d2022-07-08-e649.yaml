  <p>In this episode, we talk about philosophy of mind and cognitive science. We start
  by discussing their relationship, and the role of experimental philosophy. We then
  get into mental representations, what they are, and why cognitive science needs
  them. We get deep into perception, what it is, how it works, how different modes
  of perception influence one another, the relationship between cognition and perception,
  the difference between perceptual content and mental imagery, and how action influences
  perception.</p>
