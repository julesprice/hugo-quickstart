shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 30th 2020.  \nDr. Jean-Fran\xE7ois Bonnefon (PhD, cognitive\
  \ psychology) is a Research Director at the French Centre National de la Recherche\
  \ Scientifique, affiliated to the Toulouse School of Economics, the Toulouse School\
  \ of Management, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse. He holds the\
  \ Moral AI chair at the Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute,\
  \ and is the president of the European Commission expert group on the ethics of\
  \ driverless mobility. He conducts research on decisions which have a moral component,\
  \ especially in the context of machine ethics and human-AI cooperation. His research\
  \ appeared in 100+ academic articles, in outlets that include Science, Nature, and\
  \ PNAS.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about morality from a cognitive science perspective,\
  \ machine behavior, and moral machines. First, we discuss the role of trust, universals\
  \ and variations in moral decisions, selfish hedonic maximizers. We then get into\
  \ issues related to how intrasexual competition affects moral behavior. Finally,\
  \ we talk about machine behavior, moral machines, and machines as social catalysts,\
  \ with special focus on autonomous vehicles.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:00  Morality from\
