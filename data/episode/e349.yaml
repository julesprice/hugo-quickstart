  \ talk about morality from a cognitive science perspective, machine behavior, and\
  \ moral machines. First, we discuss the role of trust, universals and variations\
  \ in moral decisions, selfish hedonic maximizers. We then get into issues related\
  \ to how intrasexual competition affects moral behavior. Finally, we talk about\
  \ machine behavior, moral machines, and machines as social catalysts, with special\
  \ focus on autonomous vehicles.</p>\n"
