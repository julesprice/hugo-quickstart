shownotes: "<p>Dr. Jeff McMahan is White\u2019s Professor of Moral Philosophy at the\
  \ University of Oxford. He specializes in Practical Ethics, Political Philosophy,\
  \ and Ethics. He\u2019s the author of books like The Morality of Nationalism, The\
  \ Ethics of Killing: Problems at the Margins of Life, and Killing in War.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about the ethics of killing. We first clarify what is\
  \ death and what constitutes an act of killing. We discuss the connection between\
  \ psychological capacities and moral status, and the notions of personal identity,\
  \ egoistic concern, and the interest in one\u2019s future. We address abortion and\
  \ infanticide. We then get into a discussion surrounding how we decide that a life\
  \ is worth living. We also include topics like personality variability, and end-of-life\
  \ cases life euthanasia and suicide. We talk about what is a \u201Cgood life\u201D\
  \ for people and other animals. Finally, we explore what is ethically different\
  \ between killing and letting die.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. McMahan\u2019s\
