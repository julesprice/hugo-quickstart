shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 1st 2021.  \nDr. Scott A. Small is the Director of the\
  \ Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at Columbia University, where he is the\
  \ Boris and Rose Katz Professor of Neurology. He is appointed in the Departments\
  \ of Neurology, Radiology, and Psychiatry. With an expertise in Alzheimer\u2019\
  s disease and cognitive aging, Dr. Small\u2019s research focuses on the hippocampus,\
  \ a circuit in the brain targeted by these and other disorders, notably schizophrenia.\
  \ He has pioneered the development and application of high-resolution functional\
  \ MRI techniques that can pinpoint parts of the hippocampus most affected by aging\
  \ and disease. His lab then uses this information to try to identify causes of these\
  \ disorders. Over the years, his lab has used this \u2018top-down\u2019 approach\
  \ to isolate pathogenic mechanisms related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cognitive\
  \ aging, and schizophrenia. More recently, his lab has used this insight for drug\
  \ discovery and to develop novel therapeutic interventions, some of which are currently\
  \ being tested in patients. He is the author of Forgetting: The Benefits of Not\
  \ Remembering.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Forgetting. We first talk about some\
  \ of the basics of how memory works. We then talk about forgetting, bot its benefits,\
  \ and conditions where it gets pathological, like Alzheimer\u2019s. We also talk\
  \ about PTDS and autism. Finally, we discuss if people should want to have better\
  \ memories, and if it is possible to improve memory.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro\
