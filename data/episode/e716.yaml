  \ of National Security at Tel Aviv University, in Israel. He is the founder and\
  \ head of the University's International Program in Security and Diplomacy Executive\
  \ Master\u2019s Program in Diplomacy and Security. He\u2019s also the author of\

  \ The Long History and Deep Roots of Political Ethnicity and Nationalism. His most\
  \ recent book is Ideological Fixation: From the Stone Age to Today\u2019s Culture\
  \ Wars.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Ideological Fixation. We start by addressing\
  \ the premise of the book, and the current relevance of understanding ideology.\
  \ We talk about ideology and its psychological foundations. We discuss what truth\
  \ is, and the postmodernist challenge. We talk about the conflict between religion\
  \ and science, and go through ideologies like liberalism, socialism, and fascism.\
  \ We also discuss the ideological conflict between the \u201CWest\u201D and the\
  \ \u201CRest\u201D, the biggest debates in contemporary liberal democracies, and\
  \ the \u201Cculture wars\u201D. We talk about intellectuals as the source of most\
  \ ideologies. Finally, we discuss if having an ideology is something bad, how to\
  \ best understand how ideologies develop, and if there are solutions for the current\
  \ ideological conflicts.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:30  The current relevance\
