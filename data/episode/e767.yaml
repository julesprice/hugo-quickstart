  \ talk about intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion regulation, the relationship\
  \ between interpersonal emotion regulation and social competence, cross-cultural\
  \ differences in emotion regulation, and the development of emotion regulation.\
  \ We discuss emotionality and academic functioning, and we discuss emotion goals\
  \ and well-being. We talk about children\u2019s political knowledge. We discuss\
  \ conceptualizations of happiness, how they vary, and their applications. We delve\
  \ into interpersonal affect worsening during the COVID-19 pandemic, and children\u2019\
