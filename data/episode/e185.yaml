shownotes: "Dr. Helen Fisher is a biological anthropologist, and a Senior Research\
  \ Fellow at The Kinsey Institute, Indiana University. She has written six books\
  \ on the evolution, biology, and psychology of human sexuality, monogamy, adultery\
  \ and divorce, gender differences in the brain, the neural chemistry of romantic\
  \ love and attachment, human biologically-based personality styles, why we fall\
  \ in love with one person rather than another, hooking up, friends with benefits,\
  \ living together and other current trends, and the future of relationships-- what\
  \ she calls: slow love. She\u2019s the author of books like Why We Love: The Nature\
  \ and Chemistry of Romantic Love, Why Him? Why Her?: How to Find and Keep Lasting\
  \ Love, and Anatomy of Love: A Natural History of Mating, Marriage, and Why We Stray.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on romantic love. We start off by talking about its\
  \ evolutionary and neurobiological bases. We also refer to sex differences and the\
  \ extent to which they apply to romantic love. We go through the main symptoms of\
  \ love that occur cross-culturally, as well as the hormones and neurotransmitters\
  \ associated with it. Then, we discuss the several factors that go into who people\
  \ fall in love with, including personality types. We also talk about the pattern\
  \ of 3-4 years of romantic relationships in humans, and what\u2019s being it, and\
  \ if we can really talk about a preferred mating system in humans. We focus on the\
  \ problems associated with polyamory relationships, and also on slow love as a possible\
  \ preferred approach to relationships in the future.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:13  The\
