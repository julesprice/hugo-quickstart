  \ we talk about Dr. Churchland\u2019s most recent book, Conscience. We go through\
  \ what conscience is; the evolution of morality; and some of the neuroscience of\
  \ morality. We also discuss how we go from our evolved morality to moral intuitions,\
  \ and how we acquire social norms, and how they change. We talk briefly about the\
  \ case of psychopaths, free will, and the legal system. Finally, we address how\
  \ philosophy is limited in dealing with ethics and morality, Jonathan Haidt\u2019\
  s moral foundations theory, and the case of disgust sensitivity.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
