  \ Philosopher noted for her contributions to neurophilosophy and the philosophy\
  \ of mind. She is UC President's Professor of Philosophy Emerita at the University\
  \ of California, San Diego (UCSD). She has also held an adjunct professorship at\

  \ Neurophilosophy: Toward a Unified Science of the Mind-Brain, Braintrust: What\
  \ Neuroscience Tells Us about Morality, and Conscience: The Origins of Moral Intuition.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about Dr. Churchland\u2019s most recent book, Conscience.\
  \ We go through what conscience is; the evolution of morality; and some of the neuroscience\
  \ of morality. We also discuss how we go from our evolved morality to moral intuitions,\
  \ and how we acquire social norms, and how they change. We talk briefly about the\
  \ case of psychopaths, free will, and the legal system. Finally, we address how\
  \ philosophy is limited in dealing with ethics and morality, Jonathan Haidt\u2019\
  s moral foundations theory, and the case of disgust sensitivity.\n\nTime Links:\
