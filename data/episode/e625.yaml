  \ the relationship between mating strategies and socio-political orientation, and\
  \ laughter. We start be defining mating strategies and socio-political orientation.\
  \ We then get into the relationship between the both of them, and into several of\
  \ the cues people pick from the mating market that influence their own mating strategies.\
  \ We discuss why people care about other people\u2019s mating strategies. We talk\
  \ about how age and gender might influence political orientation. We get into the\
  \ rationale behind suppressing female sexuality. We talk about support for same-sex\
  \ rights and for economic issues, like wealth redistribution. We discuss the role\
  \ of sex ratios. Finally, we talk a bit about laughter.</p>\n"
