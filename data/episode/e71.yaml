  \ books, including Phenotypic Plasticity, Philosophy of Pseudoscience, and How to\
  \ Be a Stoic.\n\nIn today\u2019s episode, we talk about how we can demarcate pseudoscience\
  \ from science. We go more specifically into certain criteria, like falsifiability,\
  \ predictability, explicability, and replicability; the distinction between pseudoscience\
  \ and anti-science; and we also discuss if science, in the end, is a cultural construct,\
  \ though not as the postmoderns would have it.  \n\nTime Links:  \n00:43  What is\
