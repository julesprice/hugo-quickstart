shownotes: '<p>In this episode, we talk about human nature and empathy. We start with
  a bit of developmental psychology, and discuss how we study babies, and how good
  they really are as models for human nature and the innateness of behavior. We also
  deal with mind-body dualism, and how people think about the physical world and the
  social world differently. We then get into moral development. We also talk about
  Against Empathy, the distinction between emotional and cognitive empathy, compassion,
  and psychopathy. We tackle the link between morality and violence, and we talk a
  little bit about dehumanization. Finally, Dr. Bloom lifts the veil on his upcoming
  book, about pleasure and/in pain.</p>
