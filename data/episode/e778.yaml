shownotes: "<p>Dr. Carles Lalueza-Fox is Director of the Natural Science Museum in\
  \ Barcelona. He is the author of Inequality: A Genetic History.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we focus on Inequality. We start by talking about the premise of the\
  \ book, and the current state of global inequality, with its social and political\
  \ consequences. We get into the scientific tools we can use to study inequality\
  \ in the past. We discuss sexual selection and assortative mating; if inequality\
  \ is the result of individual traits or social structures; unequal patterns of reproduction;\
  \ and the transition from foraging to agriculture. We discuss if the concept of\
  \ \u201Crace\u201D makes sense in genetics. We talk about archaeology; patrilocality\
  \ and high female mobility; a gender bias in reproduction; and mating systems (polygyny\
  \ and monogamy). We go through two examples of historical events that shaped population\
  \ genetics and inequality, including the European colonization of the Americas and\
  \ the slave trade across the Atlantic, and the Mongol empire. We discuss the impact\
  \ of gene-editing techniques on science and society. Finally, we talk about the\
  \ future of inequality.</p>\n"
