shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 31st, 2020.  \nDr. Bo Winegard generally approaches psychological\
  \ puzzles from an evolutionary perspective, applying Darwin's theory of natural\
  \ selection to the human mind. He focuses mostly on status, group differences, individual\
  \ differences, bias, methods, and political psychology. He\u2019s also the cohost,\
  \ together with Cory Clark, of the Psyphilopod podcast.\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about the vices and defects of intellectuals and intellectual life, and also about\
  \ social conservatism, by going through some of Bo\u2019s tweets.\n\nTime Links:\
  \  \n00:32  \u201CDon\u2019t trust intellectuals when they are the last people who\
  \ actually experience the consequences of their own ideas\u201D  \n05:46  \u201C\
  One reason the intellectual elite are sometimes so loud and histrionic is because\
  \ they no longer have control over all conduit.\u201D  \n14:13  \u201CIntellectuals\
  \ are really good at catastrophizing. They believe that things matter much more\
  \ than they actually do. And then they try to save the world from various imminent\
  \ dangers. It happens on both the right and the left. The boring truth is, things\
  \ aren\u2019t that bad.\u201D  \n18:16  \u201CIntellectuals often claim (from Socrates\
  \ forward) that \u201Cthe unexamined life isn\u2019t worth living\u201D. But that\
  \ is completely untrue. I imagine that a Life spent with family, friends and community\
  \ is worth living, even without self-reflection.\u201D  \n25:22  \u201CThe great\
  \ mistake that intellectuals make is that knowledge must be articulable. Most knowledge\
  \ is intuitive. And most articulation is erroneous.\u201D  \n32:36  \u201CSocial\
  \ conservatism is so unpopular among intellectuals because it contends that the\
  \ intellect is not particularly helpful for designing social policy. Try selling\
  \ anti-athleticism to the NBA\u201D.  \n42:54  Conservatism: An Intellectual Defense\
  \  \n47:20  Tradition and prejudice are often good guides to social policy  \n51:52\
