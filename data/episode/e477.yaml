  <p>In this episode, we talk about Unassailable Ideas. We start with the thesis of
  the book, and discuss some statistics. Other topics include: cancel culture; where
  these ideas stem from; the role of universities; how these ideas move from campus
  to politics and the general public; how social media exacerbate the problem; research;
  and viewpoint diversity. Finally, we ask if the SJWs could be (morally) right, and
  discuss some of the best solutions to these issues.</p>
