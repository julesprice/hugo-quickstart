shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 2nd 2021.  \nDr. Ilana Redstone is an Associate Professor\
  \ of Sociology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Dr. Redstone's\
  \ work has focused on legal permanent residents to the United States. Using a quantitative\
  \ analytic approach, she has addressed questions surrounding a variety of dimensions\
  \ of immigrant adaptation to the U.S. She has also written on the discipline of\
  \ Sociology and the divisions therein. Dr. Redstone's current work focuses on campus\
  \ climate and viewpoint diversity. She is the author of Unassailable Ideas: How\
  \ Unwritten Rules and Social Media Shape Discourse in American Higher Education.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about Unassailable Ideas. We start with the thesis of\
  \ the book, and discuss some statistics. Other topics include: cancel culture; where\
  \ these ideas stem from; the role of universities; how these ideas move from campus\
  \ to politics and the general public; how social media exacerbate the problem; research;\
  \ and viewpoint diversity. Finally, we ask if the SJWs could be (morally) right,\
  \ and discuss some of the best solutions to these issues.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
