  <p>In this episode, we talk about episode memory and imagination. We first talk
  about episodic memory, what it is, what the ability to remember the past entails,
  why we have it, and thinking about the future. We discuss the relationship between
  memory and human communication, and the social functions of memory. Finally, we
  talk about imagination, and why we have this ability.</p>
