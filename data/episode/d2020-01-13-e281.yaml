  \ End of Sex and the Future of Human Reproduction.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus\
  \ on Dr. Greely\u2019s book, The End of Sex. First, Dr. Greely gives us an overview\
  \ of the different types of assisted reproductive technology that go into easy PDG\
  \ ((Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis), and to what extent they are develop, and\
  \ how long it would take for them to be cheaper, safer and better. Then we talk\
  \ about questions surrounding access to easy PGD, and equity. We also tackle genetic\
  \ engineering. We discuss some of the political and social reactions and consequences\
  \ of easy PGD, including the possibility of some people becoming \u201Cuniparents\u201D\
  . Finally, we debate the extent to which parents should be held responsible for\
  \ the decisions they make about how they modify their children, and Dr. Greely tells\
  \ us if we can expect easy PGD to be, generally, a positive or a negative thing\
  \ for human society.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Greely\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty\
