shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 6th 2021.  \nDr. Jessica Thompson is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Anthropology at Yale University. Dr. Thompson specializes in human evolution,\
  \ and especially those aspects that can be revealed through the analysis of ancient\
  \ animal bones found at archaeological sites (zooarchaeology). She leads the Malawi\
  \ Ancient Lifeways and Peoples Project in Malawi, central Africa, where she has\
  \ maintained a field site since 2009. This multidisciplinary work combines archaeological\
  \ science, evolutionary theory, and hunter-gatherer ethnography to develop and interpret\
  \ the first cultural and paleoenvironmental chronologies in the region that span\
  \ the transition from the last Ice Age. Her other research, based on collaborative\
  \ work in Ethiopia, targets the opposite end of the archaeological record, at its\
  \ origin in the Pliocene. Dr. Thompson is PI of the Osteoarchaeology Laboratory\
  \ at Yale University.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about human evolution and hunter-gatherer\
  \ societies. We first talk about the Malawi Ancient Lifeways and Peoples Project.\
  \ We then discuss several aspects of our evolution, including: our origins; what\
  \ a modern human is; the so-called \u201Ccognitive revolution\u201D; how the last\
  \ Ice Age impacted our evolution; \u201Crace\u201D, and its implications for medicine;\
  \ and if modern hunter-gatherers are good models of the societies we evolved in.\
  \ Finally, we discuss a recent paper on the environmental impact of anthropogenic\
  \ fires, and how humans impacted their environments during our evolutionary history\
  \ more generally, including the extinction of megafauna.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
