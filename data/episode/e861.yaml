shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 7th 2023.  \nL\xE9o Fitouchi is a PhD candidate in evolutionary\
  \ and cognitive social sciences at \xC9cole Normale Sup\xE9rieure in Paris (Department\
  \ of Cognitive Science). He is part of the Evolution and Social Cognition team of\
  \ the Institut Jean-Nicod. He is mostly interested in understanding how human social\
  \ behavior and cultural traditions are shaped by evolved cognitive mechanisms and\
  \ cultural evolutionary processes \u2013\u2013 with a particular focus on moral\
  \ intuitions, supernatural beliefs, and social norms and institutions.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about the evolution of human moral cognition and moral emotions.\
  \ We start by discussing the role of emotions in moral cognition, and the distinction\
  \ between social and moral emotions. We go through examples of moral emotions like\
  \ indignation, guilt, shame, disgust, and empathy. We talk about the social role\
  \ of institutionalized punishment, the rise of moralizing religions, and the functions\
  \ of beliefs in supernatural punishment. We discuss the evolution of puritanical\
  \ morality, and why people moralize harmless body pleasures. Finally, we talk about\
  \ an evolutionary contractualist theory of morality.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
