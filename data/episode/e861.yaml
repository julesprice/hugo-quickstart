  \ beliefs, and social norms and institutions.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we talk about the evolution of human moral cognition and moral emotions. We start\
  \ by discussing the role of emotions in moral cognition, and the distinction between\
  \ social and moral emotions. We go through examples of moral emotions like indignation,\
  \ guilt, shame, disgust, and empathy. We talk about the social role of institutionalized\n\
  punishment, the rise of moralizing religions, and the functions of beliefs in supernatural\
  \ punishment. We discuss the evolution of puritanical morality, and why people moralize\
  \ harmless body pleasures. Finally, we talk about an evolutionary contractualist\
  \ theory of morality.</p>\n"
