shownotes: "Dr. Richard Haier is Professor Emeritus in the Pediatric Neurology Division\
  \ of the School of Medicine at University of California, Irvine. He is also the\
  \ editor-in-chief of the journal Intelligence since 2016. In 1994, he was one of\
  \ 52 signatories on \"Mainstream Science on Intelligence,\" an editorial written\
  \ by the American psychologist Linda Gottfredson and published in the Wall Street\
  \ Journal, which summarized findings from intelligence research. His work on the\
  \ parieto-frontal integration theory (P-FIT) with Rex Jung examines the neuroanatomy\
  \ of intelligence based on neuro-imaging research. He\u2019s also the author of\
  \ the book \u201CThe Neuroscience of Intelligence\u201D (2016).\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about psychometrics and intelligence. First, Dr. Haier explains what psychometrics\
  \ is about, and how and why we can reliably measure psychological traits. Then,\
  \ we discuss what intelligence is, the relationship between general intelligence,\
  \ the g factor and IQ; the limitations of IQ testing; the correlation between IQ\
  \ and life outcomes; genetic and environmental factors in IQ. We also refer to the\
  \ neuroscience of intelligence, and the aspects of the brain that go associated\
  \ with IQ. We also get into controversial aspects of intelligence research, like\
  \ sex differences and race differences. We finish up by talking about the differences\
  \ between human general intelligence and artificial intelligence, and the impact\
  \ that these systems might have in society.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:10  Psychometrics,\
