  \ Haier is Professor Emeritus in the Pediatric Neurology Division of the School\
  \ of Medicine at University of California, Irvine. He is also the editor-in-chief\
  \ of the journal Intelligence since 2016. In 1994, he was one of 52 signatories\
  \ on \"Mainstream Science on Intelligence,\" an editorial written by the American\
  \ psychologist Linda Gottfredson and published in the Wall Street Journal, which\
  \ summarized findings from intelligence research. His work on the parieto-frontal\
  \ integration theory (P-FIT) with Rex Jung examines the neuroanatomy of intelligence\
  \ based on neuro-imaging research. He\u2019s also the author of the book \u201C\
  The Neuroscience of Intelligence\u201D (2016).</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk\
  \ about psychometrics and intelligence. First, Dr. Haier explains what psychometrics\
  \ is about, and how and why we can reliably measure psychological traits. Then,\
  \ we discuss what intelligence is, the relationship between general intelligence,\
  \ the g factor and IQ; the limitations of IQ testing; the correlation between IQ\
  \ and life outcomes; genetic and environmental factors in IQ. We also refer to the\
  \ neuroscience of intelligence, and the aspects of the brain that go associated\
  \ with IQ. We also get into controversial aspects of intelligence research, like\
  \ sex differences and race differences. We finish up by talking about the differences\
  \ between human general intelligence and artificial intelligence, and the impact\
  \ that these systems might have in society.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Haier\u2019\
