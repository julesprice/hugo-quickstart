shownotes: "Dr. Valerie Curtis is Director of the Environmental Health Group, a multidisciplinary\
  \ group researching hygiene, sanitation and water (WASH), at the London School Hygiene\
  \ and Tropical Medicine. She is trained in engineering, epidemiology and anthropology\
  \ and studies human behavior from an evolutionary perspective. She\u2019s also the\
  \ author of the book Don\u2019t Look, Don\u2019t Touch, Don\u2019t Eat: The Science\
  \ Behind Revulsion. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about the emotion of disgust, and\
  \ how it might have evolved. How it manifests in us and also other animals, in the\
  \ form of avoidance behavior. Also, how disgust eventually leads us to avoid people\
  \ that don\u2019t belong to our social group, and how it might be behind some moral\
  \ norms related to purity and pollution. Finally, we get to talk about how we can\
  \ apply this knowledge to acquire better hygiene habits, and the influence of the\
  \ environment settings.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:40  What is disgust, and how it works\
