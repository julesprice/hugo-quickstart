  t Eat: The Science Behind Revulsion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about\
  \ the emotion of disgust, and how it might have evolved. How it manifests in us\
  \ and also other animals, in the form of avoidance behavior. Also, how disgust eventually\
  \ leads us to avoid people that don\u2019t belong to our social group, and how it\
  \ might be behind some moral norms related to purity and pollution. Finally, we\
  \ get to talk about how we can apply this knowledge to acquire better hygiene habits,\
  \ and the influence of the environment settings.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:40\
