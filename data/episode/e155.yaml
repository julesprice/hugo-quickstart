  \ Excellence for both Teaching and Research. In addition to teaching various courses\
  \ and directing the New Paltz Evolutionary Psychology Lab, Dr. Geher serves as founding\
  \ director of the campus\u2019 Evolutionary Studies (EvoS) program. He is also credited\

  \ Intelligence Unleashed: The Role of the Mind in Sex, Dating, and Love, and Straightforward\
  \ Statistics. In Darwin's Subterranean World: Evolution, Mind, and Mating Intelligence,\
  \ his Psychology Today blog, Dr. Geher addresses various topics related to the human\
  \ condition.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about the evolution of human mating,\
  \ mating intelligence and the PsychTable, a periodic table of evolved psychological\
  \ adaptations. We first go through the evolutionary bases of human mating, including\
  \ the importance of sexual competition and sexual selection, and distinguishing\
  \ between short-term and long-term strategies in both sexes. Then, we discuss Mating\
  \ Intelligence and if it really varies independently of General Intelligence and\
  \ IQ, and also attachment theory. Finally, we talk about the PychTable; the criteria\
  \ for considering something an adaptation; some criticisms of Evolutionary Psychology\
  \ (EP); and also the relationship between EP and Biology, and if in the future it\
  \ could be the unifying framework for all of the branches of Psychology.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n\
