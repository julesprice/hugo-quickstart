shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 16th 2022.  \nDr. Matteo Colombo is an Associate\
  \ Professor in the Tilburg Center for Logic, Ethics, and Philosophy of Science,\
  \ and in the Department of Philosophy at Tilburg University. Much of his work is\
  \ in the foundations of computational neuroscience, philosophy of science, philosophy\
  \ of mind, and moral psychology. He is especially interested in the places where\
  \ these areas overlap.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about topics in neuroscience,\
  \ cognitive science, and philosophy of science. We start by talking about experimental\
  \ philosophy and the questions it deals with. We talk about the relationship between\
  \ intellectual humility and prejudice. We discuss large-scale brain simulations,\
  \ what they aim at, and if they have been productive. We address debates in the\
  \ cognitive sciences like the levels of explanation debate, and the debate between\
  \ the nativists and the empiricists. We discuss if value-free science is possible;\
  \ what the appraisal of scientific hypotheses is influenced by; and the relationship\
  \ between neuroscience, philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, and moral psychology.\n\
