  \ we talk about early life stressors and their impact on physiology and decision-making.\
  \ We talk about how early life disadvantages impact development, particularly at\
  \ the level of physiology. We get into the relationship between immune function\
  \ and decision-making. We discuss how a fast life history strategy impacts eating\
  \ behavior, mating behavior/preferences, and punishment sensitivity. Finally, we\
  \ talk about Dr. Mengelkoch\u2019s current and future work.</p>\n"
