shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 20th 2022.  \nDr. Summer Mengelkoch has recently finished\
  \ her PhD in experimental social psychology at Texas Christian University. She has\
  \ just accepted a postdoc position at UCLA under George Slavich. She earned a B.A.\
  \ from the University of Minnesota in 2013, and an M.S. From Texas Christian University\
  \ in 2020. Dr. Mengelkoch seeks to better understand relationships between biology\
  \ and behavior. To do so, she investigates relationships between biological factors\
  \ (including hormones, hormonal contraceptive use, and immune function) and behaviors\
  \ (including eating behavior, mate preferences, cognition, and decision-making).\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about early life stressors and their impact on physiology\
  \ and decision-making. We talk about how early life disadvantages impact development,\
  \ particularly at the level of physiology. We get into the relationship between\
  \ immune function and decision-making. We discuss how a fast life history strategy\
  \ impacts eating behavior, mating behavior/preferences, and punishment sensitivity.\
  \ Finally, we talk about Dr. Mengelkoch\u2019s current and future work.\n\nTime\
