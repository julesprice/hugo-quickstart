shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 16th 2022.  \nDr. Aaron Sell is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Psychology and Criminology at Heidelberg University. He is an evolutionary\
  \ psychologist interested in anger and aggression, hatred, and formidability estimation.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about the evolution of the emotions of anger and hatred.\
  \ We star by discussing emotions from an evolutionary perspective. We talk about\
  \ anger, its functions, what triggers it, and cues of strength. We then get into\
  \ hatred, how it differs from anger, and their relationship with revenge and conflict.\
  \ We talk about how males assess fighting ability. We discuss if emotions are adaptations.\
  \ Finally, we talk about justice-making institutions, and ask if criminal justice\
  \ is based on punishment or repair.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:32  Understanding\
