  \ Myths about Human Nature, and Why We Believe: Evolution and the Human Way of Being.</p>\n\
  <p>This interview is part of the series on the 150thanniversary of Darwin\u2019\
  s Descent of Man.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about biological anthropology,\
  \ and Darwin\u2019s Descent of Man. We get a bit into the field of Biological Anthropology,\
  \ and talk about the kinds of questions it deals with. We talk about belief. We\
  \ then get into some myths about human evolution, including race and sex differences,\
  \ in the context of Darwin\u2019s Descent of Man. We discuss monogamy and human\
  \ mating systems. We talk about some issues with taking modern hunter-gatherers\
  \ as representative of ancestral societies, and with some ideas in evolutionary\
  \ psychology, like the concept of the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Other\
  \ topics include aggression as an illustrative example of how people theorize about\
  \ sex differences; human nature; and the overall importance of Darwin\u2019s theories.</p>\n"
