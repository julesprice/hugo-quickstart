shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 18th 2021.  \nDr. Douglas P. Fry is Professor and Chair\
  \ in the Department of Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of North Carolina\
  \ at Greensboro. He has written extensively on aggression, conflict, and conflict\
  \ resolution in his own books and in journals such as Science and American Anthropologist.\
  \ His work frequently engages the debate surrounding the origins of war, arguing\
  \ against claims that war or lethal aggression is rooted in human evolution. He\u2019\
  s the author or editor of books like The Human Potential for Peace; Beyond War;\
  \ War, Peace, and Human Nature; and Nurturing Our Humanity.\n\nThis is our second\
  \ interview on the anthropology of war. You can find the first one here: https://youtu.be/uz9xPBQ_CO0\n\
  \nIn this episode, we expand on the topics I covered in our first interview, and\
  \ talk about: how old is war; what drives war \u2013 factors like population density,\
  \ sedentarism, and social complexity; how we can be sure that a death in the archaeological\
  \ record was caused by war; peace social systems, and how they are maintained, both\
  \ in traditional small-scale societies and industrialized societies; and how we\
  \ can promote peace and international cooperation, and in dealing with threats like\
  \ global pandemics and climate change. Finally, we talk about Dr. Fry\u2019s upcoming\
  \ book on peace systems.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:34  How old is war?\
