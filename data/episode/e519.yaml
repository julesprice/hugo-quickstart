  <p>In this episode, we expand on the topics I covered in our first interview, and\
  \ talk about: how old is war; what drives war \u2013 factors like population density,\
  \ sedentarism, and social complexity; how we can be sure that a death in the archaeological\
  \ record was caused by war; peace social systems, and how they are maintained, both\
  \ in traditional small-scale societies and industrialized societies; and how we\
  \ can promote peace and international cooperation, and in dealing with threats like\
  \ global pandemics and climate change. Finally, we talk about Dr. Fry\u2019s upcoming\
  \ book on peace systems.</p>\n"
