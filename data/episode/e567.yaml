shownotes: "<p>Dr. Chris Knight is Honorary Professor in the Department of Anthropology\
  \ at University College London. Over many years, he has been exploring the idea\
  \ that human language and culture emerged in our species not purely through gradual\
  \ Darwinian evolution but in a cumulative process culminating in sudden revolutionary\
  \ change. The details of his \u2018sex strike\u2019 theory remain controversial,\
  \ but the general idea that the transition to language was a \u2018major transition\u2019\
  \ or \u2018revolution\u2019 (often termed the human revolution) has been current\
  \ for many years and is now widely agreed.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about\
  \ Dr. Knight\u2019s hypothesis about the emergence of human language. We discuss\
  \ the social conditions that are needed for language to develop, and tackle questions\
  \ surrounding language nativism and why other animals do not have language. We also\
  \ get into cultural evolution, and its relationship with matrilocality.</p>\n"
