  \ We talk about realism in science, the \u201Cscientific perspective\u201D, and\
  \ the perspectival nature in scientific representation. We discuss pluralism in\
  \ science. We talk about perspectival modelling, and the problem of inconsistent\
  \ models. We discuss data, phenomena, and their relationship. We talk about natural\
  \ kinds, and contingentism. Finally, we discuss multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism\
  \ in science, and whether science is really about knowing what objective reality\
  \ is.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:43  Realism in science, and the \u201C\
