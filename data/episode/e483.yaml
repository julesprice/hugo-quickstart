shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 9th 2021.  \nDr. Lauren Brent is Associate Professor\
  \ in the Centre for Research in Animal Behaviour at the University of Exeter. She\
  \ is a biologist interested in the evolution of sociality. Her research asks why\
  \ social relationships are formed and how they are maintained. Her work focuses\
  \ on highly gregarious, group-living animals. She works mostly with data collected\
  \ from wild or free-ranging groups, and specialize on study systems with uniquely\
  \ long-term datasets. She uses a diverse set of methods, including techniques from\
  \ ethology, evolutionary biology, quantitative and functional genetics, life-history\
  \ evolution, endocrinology, comparative psychology, and cognitive neuroscience.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about the evolution of sociality. We first ask what sociality\
  \ is. We then go through topics like: individual variation in how animals establish\
  \ social relations; what social complexity is; the importance and benefits of social\
  \ connections; how kin selection and reciprocal altruism influence social organization;\
  \ indirect connections; friendships; how prolonged life after reproduction evolved;\
  \ a case study from 2012 about how rhesus macaques reacted to a group member that\
  \ died of a fatal attack; and neuroethology.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:44\
