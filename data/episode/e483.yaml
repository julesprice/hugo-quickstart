shownotes: '<p>Dr. Lauren Brent is Associate Professor in the Centre for Research
  in Animal Behaviour at the University of Exeter. She is a biologist interested in
  the evolution of sociality. Her research asks why social relationships are formed
  and how they are maintained. Her work focuses on highly gregarious, group-living
  animals. She works mostly with data collected from wild or free-ranging groups,
  and specialize on study systems with uniquely long-term datasets. She uses a diverse
  set of methods, including techniques from ethology, evolutionary biology, quantitative
  and functional genetics, life-history evolution, endocrinology, comparative psychology,
  and cognitive neuroscience.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about the evolution of sociality. We first ask what
  sociality is. We then go through topics like: individual variation in how animals
  establish social relations; what social complexity is; the importance and benefits
  of social connections; how kin selection and reciprocal altruism influence social
  organization; indirect connections; friendships; how prolonged life after reproduction
  evolved; a case study from 2012 about how rhesus macaques reacted to a group member
  that died of a fatal attack; and neuroethology.</p>
