shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 16th 2021.  \nDr. Aiyana Koka Willard is a Lecturer\
  \ in the Centre for Culture and Evolution at Brunel University London. Her research\
  \ focuses around the culture and cognitive origins of supernatural and religious\
  \ beliefs. She is particularly interested in how thinking about minds and causal\
  \ reasoning is related to supernatural beliefs. Her current research focuses on\
  \ witchcraft, karma, and evil eye beliefs.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the\
  \ anthropology and cognitive science of religion. We start with a discussing about\
  \ the cognitive bases of religion, and how to understand religion as a cultural\
  \ practice. We talk about the mechanisms that might explain why some religious ideas\
  \ are more memorable and stickier than others. We address the relationship between\
  \ religion and morality. We go through practices and beliefs like witchcraft, karma,\
  \ and evil eye beliefs. Finally, we talk about some of the communities Dr. Willard\
  \ has studied, and what they might tell us about human universals. \n\nTime Links:\
