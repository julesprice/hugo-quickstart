  \ we focus on The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence. We first get into some historical\
  \ background, and talk about how old the concept of AI is. We discuss how we should\
  \ be realistic in our worries about future AI developments. We talk about principles\
  \ of ethical AI, and a distinction between soft and hard ethics. We go through challenges\
  \ posed by algorithms, and how AI can be used for criminal activity. Finally, we\
  \ talk about the idea of AI for Social Good.</p>\n"
