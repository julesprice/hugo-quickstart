shownotes: "<p>Dr. Jeremy DeSilva is an Associate Professor of Anthropology at Dartmouth\
  \ College. He is the author of A Most Interesting Problem: What Darwin\u2019s Descent\
  \ of Man Got Right and Wrong about Human Evolution.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we\
  \ focus on A Most Interesting Problem, and Darwin\u2019s Descend of Man. We first\
  \ discuss the Descent of Man in its historical context, and compare it to the Origin\
  \ of Species, and try to trace back the origins of some of its most prominent ideas.\
  \ We talk about part 1 of the book, and the evolutionary origins of our mental faculties,\
  \ and what Darwin had to say about race and sex differences. We get into Darwin\u2019\
  s insights on our African origins, and some of the most important ideas in the field\
  \ of paleoanthropology. We explain why \u201Crace\u201D is not a useful scientific\
  \ concept, and why \u201Ccline\u201D is a much better one to understand human biodiversity.\
  \ We also talk about how revolutionary the idea of sexual selection was. Finally,\
  \ we discuss why some of Darwin\u2019s ideas were/are problematic, with a focus\
  \ on a recent controversy involving Agust\xEDn Fuentes\u2019 essay on Science, and\
  \ we sum things up with what Darwin got right and wrong about human evolution.</p>\n"
