  RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 28th 2022.  \nDr. Leslie Sponsel is Professor Emeritus in the\
  \ Department of Anthropology at UH M\u0101noa, Hawai\u2019i. He is an expert in\
  \ spiritual ecology, which is the vast, complex, diverse, and dynamic arena of intellectual\
  \ and practical activities at the interfaces of religions and spiritualities with\
  \ ecologies, environments, and environmentalisms. He is the author of several books,\
  \ including the most recent one, Yanomami in the Amazon: Toward a more Ethical Anthropology\
  \ beyond Othering.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Yanomami in the Amazon. We start\
  \ by talking about the Yanomami society, what drew anthropologists to studying it,\
  \ and common misconceptions and stereotypes about it. We discuss the work of Napoleon\
  \ Chagnon on aggression, and the work of Patrick Tierney. We talk about the motivations\
  \ and biases that drive fieldwork and research. Finally, we discuss the ethics of\
  \ anthropology, and human rights.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:36  Who are\
