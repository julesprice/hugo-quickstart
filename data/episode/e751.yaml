shownotes: "<p>Dr. Leslie Sponsel is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Anthropology\
  \ at UH M\u0101noa, Hawai\u2019i. He is an expert in spiritual ecology, which is\
  \ the vast, complex, diverse, and dynamic arena of intellectual and practical activities\
  \ at the interfaces of religions and spiritualities with ecologies, environments,\
  \ and environmentalisms. He is the author of several books, including the most recent\
  \ one, Yanomami in the Amazon: Toward a more Ethical Anthropology beyond Othering.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we focus on Yanomami in the Amazon. We start by talking about\
  \ the Yanomami society, what drew anthropologists to studying it, and common misconceptions\
  \ and stereotypes about it. We discuss the work of Napoleon Chagnon on aggression,\
  \ and the work of Patrick Tierney. We talk about the motivations and biases that\
  \ drive fieldwork and research. Finally, we discuss the ethics of anthropology,\
  \ and human rights.</p>\n"
