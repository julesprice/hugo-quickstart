  <p>In this episode, we focus on Just as Deadly. We start by talking about statistics
  on serial killing, and why the focus tends to be on males. We discuss morbid curiosity,
  and why some people are interested in serial killing. We then get into psychological
  factors, like demographic data; development, life events, and trauma; motivations,
  and the modus operandi; neurological data; and sociocultural factors. We talk about
  how commentators in the media might misinform people on crime and criminals. Finally,
  we discuss a possible evolutionary rationale behind female serial killing.</p>
