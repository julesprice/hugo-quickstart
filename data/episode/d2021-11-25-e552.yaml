  <p>In this episode, we talk about synthetic biology. We discuss what is a synthetic
  cell, and how we can use it to study cell evolution and cell functions. We talk
  about the origin of life of Earth, and some of the theories out there. We also talk
  about cells before the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), and how to study cell
  evolution in the lab. Finally, we talk about the Build-a-Cell Initiative, and some
  of the main applications of synthetic cells, like basic research, biomanufacturing,
  medicine, space exploration, and astrobiology.</p>
