shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 29th, 2020.  \nDr. Daniel Kruger is Research Investigator\
  \ in the Population Studies Center at the University of Michigan. He applies evolutionary\
  \ principles to advance the understanding of a wide range of human psychology and\
  \ behavior. Much of his work is founded on Life History Theory, which provides a\
  \ powerful framework for understanding individual variation. He pursues both basic\
  \ research to advance theory as well as applied projects that leverage the most\
  \ powerful theoretical framework in the life sciences to promote human well-being\
  \ and sustainability.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about life history theory, and\
  \ its application in evolutionary psychology. We discuss mating and parenting effort,\
  \ and sex differences in life history strategies. We also talk about the evolved\
  \ psychology of time perspective. We mention how life history theory helps us better\
  \ understand certain modern health issues. And, finally, we talk about postcoital\
  \ behaviors, and sex differences related to them.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:07  What\
