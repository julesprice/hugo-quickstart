shownotes: "Dr. Dimitris Xygalatas is Associate Professor in Anthropology and Psychological\
  \ Sciences and head of the Experimental Anthropology Lab at the University of Connecticut.\
  \ He has also served as President of the International Association for the Cognitive\
  \ and Evolutionary Sciences of Religion. His interests include ritual, sports, cooperation,\
  \ the interaction between cognition and culture, and the impact of cultural practices\
  \ on psychophysiological wellbeing. He is the author of The Burning Saints: Cognition\
  \ and Culture in the Fire-walking Rituals of the Anastenaria, and, more recently,\
  \ Ritual: How Seemingly Senseless Acts Make Life Worth Living.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on Ritual. We first ask what is a ritual, and how common it is. We talk\
  \ about the functions of rituals, and how they relate to meaning. We discuss the\
  \ hypothesis that rituals drove the evolution of civilization. We talk about the\
  \ individual and social benefits of rituals, and causal opacity as a feature of\
  \ rituals. We discuss modes of religiosity theory, and get into fire-walking rituals,\
  \ and the psychological effects of costly rituals. We also talk about the relationship\
  \ between ritual and sexual selection, and the role that drugs play in some rituals.\
  \ Finally, we discuss the benefits and obstacles to an interdisciplinary approach\
  \ in the social sciences.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:45  What is a ritual?\
