shownotes: "<p>Dr. Kevin Mitchell is Associate Professor of Genetics and Neuroscience\
  \ at Trinity College Dublin. He is interested in the development of connectivity\
  \ in the brain, specifically in how this process is controlled by genes and how\
  \ mutations in such genes affect the connectivity of neuronal circuits, influence\
  \ behavior and perception and contribute to disease. His research group uses genetic\
  \ approaches in the mouse to address these questions, and they are also involved\
  \ in collaborative research looking at the genetics and phenotypic manifestations\
  \ of synaesthesia and schizophrenia in humans. He\u2019s the author of a book that\
  \ came out last year, Innate: How the Wiring of Our Brains Shapes Who We Are.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we focus on Dr. Mitchell\u2019s book, Innate. We first talk\
  \ about how to square off human nature with individual variation, and how the genome\
  \ does not encode a person, and is not the only source of innateness to psychological\
  \ traits. We also discuss behavioral genetics, the \u201Cnon-shared environment\u201D\
  , and the conclusions we can derive from polygenic scores. We then refer to how\
  \ personality shapes the way we experience the world, neuroplasticity, and psychological\
  \ epigenetics. Toward the end, we also talk about how difficult it is to study group\
  \ differences, and where sex differences come from and if it makes sense to talk\
  \ about a \u201Cmale\u201D and a \u201Cfemale\u201D brain.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow\
