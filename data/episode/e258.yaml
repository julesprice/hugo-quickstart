shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 17th, 2019.\n\nDr. Mark Silcox is a Professor and\
  \ Chair of de Department of Humanities and Philosophy at the University of Central\
  \ Oklahoma. He is the co-author (with Jon Cogburn) of Philosophy Through Video Games\
  \ (Taylor & Francis, 2008) and their co-edited Open Court Volume Dungeons & Dragons\
  \ and Philosophy: Raiding the Temple of Wisdom came out in late 2012. He is mainly\
  \ interested in metaethics, aesthetics, the philosophy of language, and the philosophy\
  \ of games.\n\nIn this episode, we go through a number of topics in the philosophy\
  \ of videogames and simulated reality. We first discuss the Robert Nozick\u2019\
  s experience machine thought experiment, and several of its philosophical implications,\
  \ including the nature of reality, our experience of reality, hedonism, and reducing\
  \ suffering in the world. We also talk about fearmongering surrounding advanced\
  \ forms of AI, and fearing \u201Cblack boxes\u201D, and also how we constantly delegate\
  \ decisions to other people whose decision-making processes we do not understand.\
  \ We talk about social media, and what it means to have \u201Cfake relationships\u201D\
  . We then get into the philosophy of videogames, and we go through the ethics of\
  \ worldbuilding; how people explore their personal identities through avatars and\
  \ archetypes; and role-playing in videogames and real life.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:06\
