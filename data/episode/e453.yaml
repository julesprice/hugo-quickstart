shownotes: '<p>In this episode, we talk about trust and cooperation. We define trust,
  and talk about trust and cooperation among strangers. We discuss individual differences
  in trust, and trust on an individual and societal level. We explore why different
  countries have different levels of interpersonal trust, differences in trust between
  individualistic and collectivistic societies, and the economic and social outcomes
  associated with it. We discuss if different groups of migrants show different levels
  of trust toward native people, and if they adapt to the society they migrate to
  across generations. We talk about the personality traits associated with prosocial
  behavior. We refer to the bystander effect, and the explanations behind it. Finally,
  we ask if it is possible to increase levels of interpersonal trust.</p>
