shownotes: "RECORDED ON March 20th, 2020.  \nDr. Hugo Mercier is a research scientist\
  \ at the CNRS \u2013 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (Institut Jean\
  \ Nicod), where he works with the Evolution and Social Cognition team. Most of his\
  \ work so far has focused on the function and workings of reasoning. He\u2019s the\

  s recent book, Not Born Yesterday. He walks us through the recent science that goes\

  \ and easily manipulated and deceived. We explore examples in the domains of politics,\
  \ social media, science, and others.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:46  The history of believing\
