shownotes: "<p>Dr. Diana Fleischman completed a PhD in Evolutionary Psychology at\
  \ the University of Texas, Austin, US, under the supervision of David Buss. She\
  \ is currently a senior lecturer of Psychology at the University of Portsmouth,\
  \ as well as a member of the Comparative and Evolutionary Psychology group there.\
  \ Her research interests are hormonal influences on behavior, human sexuality, disgust\
  \ and, recently, the interface of evolutionary psychology and behaviorism.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about the evolutionary psychology of sex robots, and\
  \ how they might impact men and human society. We talk about why men will be the\
  \ primary marketing targets, and the several different ways sex robots might have\
  \ a positive impact in their lives. During the discussion, we also tackle arguments\
  \ against sex robots, or arguments that suggest their impact might be net negative.</p>\n\
