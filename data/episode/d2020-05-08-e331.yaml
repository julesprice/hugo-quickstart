shownotes: "<p>Dr. Hugo Mercier is a research scientist at the CNRS \u2013 Centre\
  \ National de la Recherche Scientifique (Institut Jean Nicod), where he works with\
  \ the Evolution and Social Cognition team. Most of his work so far has focused on\
  \ the function and workings of reasoning. He\u2019s the author of The Enigma of\
  \ Reason, and, more recently, Not Born Yesterday: The Science of Who We Trust and\
  \ What We Believe.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we center on Dr. Mercier\u2019s recent\
  \ book, Not Born Yesterday. He walks us through the recent science that goes against\
  \ the prevailing narrative in social psychology, that we are extremely gullible,\
  \ and easily manipulated and deceived. We explore examples in the domains of politics,\
  \ social media, science, and others.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Mercier\u2019\
