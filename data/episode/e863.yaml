shownotes: "<p>Dr. Diane O\u2019Leary is a Public Voices Fellow for Advancing the\
  \ Rights of Women and Girls with Equality Now and the op-ed project. She has a PhD\
  \ in philosophy from University of Sydney, and an MA in philosophy from Syracuse\
  \ University.\_ In both cases her focus was metaphysics, though for the PhD she\
  \ gave her attention to Plato, and the application of his metaphysical views to\
  \ his choices as writer. In her work she focuses on philosophy of mind, clinical\
  \ medicine, and gender equity.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about\
  \ topics in the philosophy of medicine. We talk about the relationship between philosophy\
  \ and medicine. We discuss the issues with how medicine deals with mind-body dualism,\n\
  and property dualism. We talk about objectivity and subjectivity in medicine. We\
  \ discuss how psychosomatic symptoms are dealt with, and the specific case of the\
  \ history of chronic fatigue syndrome. We talk about how medically unexplained symptoms\
  \ are dealt with institutionally and in research, and the importance of taking patients\u2019\
  \ claims seriously. We talk about limitations of the biopsychosocial model. We discuss\
  \ gender bias in healthcare and psychiatry, the legacy of the diagnosis of hysteria,\
  \ and why women go to the doctor more often. Finally, we discuss why philosophy\
  \ is still relevant.</p>\n"
