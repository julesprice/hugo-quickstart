  Dr. Diane O\u2019Leary is a Public Voices Fellow for Advancing the Rights of Women\
  \ and Girls with Equality Now and the op-ed project. She has a PhD in philosophy\
  \ from University of Sydney, and an MA in philosophy from Syracuse University. \
  \ In both cases her focus was metaphysics, though for the PhD she gave her attention\
  \ to Plato, and the application of his metaphysical views to his choices as writer.\
  \ In her work she focuses on philosophy of mind, clinical medicine, and gender equity.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about topics in the philosophy of medicine. We talk about\
  \ the relationship between philosophy and medicine. We discuss the issues with how\
  \ medicine deals with mind-body dualism, and property dualism. We talk about objectivity\
  \ and subjectivity in medicine. We discuss how psychosomatic symptoms are dealt\
  \ with, and the specific case of the history of chronic fatigue syndrome. We talk\
  \ about how medically unexplained symptoms are dealt with institutionally and in\
  \ research, and the importance of taking patients\u2019 claims seriously. We talk\
  \ about limitations of the biopsychosocial model. We discuss gender bias in healthcare\
  \ and psychiatry, the legacy of the diagnosis of hysteria, and why women go to the\
  \ doctor more often. Finally, we discuss why philosophy is still relevant.\n\nTime\
