summary: In this episode, we focus on tool use and vocalizations from chimpanzees,
  bonobos and orangutans. We start with toll use, and go through some general topics,
  like how transmission of cultural knowledge occurs in these species, if they have
  cumulative culture or not, and their relationship with us. We then talk about vocalizations
  and intentional communication, before addressing the topics of affective social
  learning, behavioral plasticity, and the relation between environmental variation
  and the evolution of culture. Finally, we discuss overimitation in human infants.
