shownotes: "<p>Dr. Mark Blyth is William R. Roads Professor of International Economics\
  \ at Brown University. His research interests lie in the field of international\
  \ political economy. More specifically, his research trespasses several fields and\
  \ aims to be as interdisciplinary as possible, drawing from political science, economics,\
  \ sociology, complexity theory, and evolutionary theory. His work falls into several\
  \ related areas: the politics of ideas, how institutions change, political parties,\
  \ and the politics of finance. He\u2019s also the author of books like Great Transformations:\
  \ Economic Ideas and Institutional Change in the Twentieth Century, and Austerity:\
  \ The History of a Dangerous Idea.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about the origins\
  \ of the economic idea of austerity, and its development over history. We also tackle\
  \ the notion of ordoliberalism, and how it connects with Germany, and how the European\
  \ Union was economically structured. How the 70\u2019s stagflation and the global\
  \ financial crisis of 2007/2008 changed the course of economics and politics. And\
  \ also what Dr. Blyth calls the phenomenon of Global Trumpism, and political populism\
  \ on both the right and the left. We finish up by talking a bit about current economic\
  \ issues, notably economic inequality in the West and global warming, and how to\
  \ deal with them.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:40 The origins of austerity</p>\n\
