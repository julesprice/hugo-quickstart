shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 12th 2021.  \nDr. Robert Larzelere is Professor and\
  \ Research Methodologist in the College of Education and Human Sciences at Oklahoma\
  \ State University. He is interested in collaborating with others who are concerned\
  \ about the best scientific evidence on important questions about family and family-type\
  \ relationships. He investigates specific disciplinary processes that account for\
  \ the effectiveness of the authoritative parenting combination of warmth, communication,\
  \ just-firm-enough control and increasing autonomy. He is interested in comparing\
  \ the effectiveness of alternative disciplinary responses to misbehavior and searching\
  \ for alternative tactics that are more effective than non-abusive spanking in situations\
  \ where the latter has traditionally been used.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ parenting and parenting tactics like spanking. We first discuss parenting styles,\
  \ and temperamental differences in children. We get more into detail about authoritative\
  \ parenting. We talk about spanking, when it is effective, when it is abusive, and\
  \ alternatives to it. We also discuss the effects of spanking bans, with focus on\
  \ Sweden. Finally, we talk about what can be the negative outcomes of adopting the\
  \ wrong style of parenting, particularly when dealing with the more defiant children.\n\
