  College of Education and Human Sciences at Oklahoma State University. He is interested
  in collaborating with others who are concerned about the best scientific evidence
  on important questions about family and family-type relationships. He investigates

  <p>In this episode, we talk about parenting and parenting tactics like spanking.
  We first discuss parenting styles, and temperamental differences in children. We
  get more into detail about authoritative parenting. We talk about spanking, when
  it is effective, when it is abusive, and alternatives to it. We also discuss the
  effects of spanking bans, with focus on Sweden. Finally, we talk about what can
  be the negative outcomes of adopting the wrong style of parenting, particularly
  when dealing with the more defiant children.</p>
