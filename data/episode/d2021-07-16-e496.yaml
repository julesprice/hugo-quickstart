  <p>In this episode, we focus on Figuring Out The Past. We start by discussing some\
  \ possible limitations of (narrative) History, and what SHESHAT\u2019s approach\
  \ has to offer. We talk about many different kinds of patterns we find across societies\
  \ and across time, and how societies are similar but also differ from one another.\
  \ We discuss cultural evolution, how it works in different domains, and things like\
  \ rates of innovation. We ask why societies rise and fall. We discuss the role religion\
  \ plays in society. We also talk about how to make sense of some of the statistics\
  \ presented in the book, particularly the ones related to standing armies, collective\
  \ rituals, monuments, and cultural tools like calendars, law codes, and bureaucracy.\
  \ Finally, we ask if it is possible to use these date to understand contemporary\
  \ events and to predict future events.</p>\n"
