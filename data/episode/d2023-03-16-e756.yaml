shownotes: "<p>Dr. Donald Hoffman is a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Cognitive\
  \ Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. He is the author of The Case\
  \ Against Reality: Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we focus on The Case Against Reality, and the interface theory of perception.\
  \ We start by discussing the interface theory of perception, shape as an effective\
  \ code for fitness, different ways of perceiving \u201Creality\u201D, and what is\
  \ \u201Creal\u201D. We address scientific and philosophical objections to the theory,\
  \ and epistemological approaches that might differ from empirical science. We talk\
  \ about simulated realities, and discuss if they are really different from what\
  \ we normally perceive. We talk about the use of psychedelics; and spirits, ghosts,\
  \ and gods as experiences. We ask if \u201Ctruth-seeing\u201D organisms could evolve,\
  \ and if we could ever perceive objective reality. Finally, we talk about breaking\
  \ the tension between science and spiritual and religious traditions.</p>\n"
