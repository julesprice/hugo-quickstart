shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 11th 2020.  \nDr. Matthew Cobb is Professor of Zoology\
  \ at the University of Manchester, where his research focuses on the sense of smell,\
  \ insect behavior and the history of science. He is also a historian of the French\
  \ Resistance. He\u2019s the author of several books, including The Idea of the Brain:\
  \ A History.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about The Idea of the Brain, and the history\
  \ and approaches in the discipline of neuroscience. We start with some of the history\
  \ about where people located the mind in the body, when we started locating mind\
  \ in the brain, and several different metaphors that researchers used in science.\
  \ We discuss if artificial intelligence can create good models of the mind/brain.\
  \ We talk about localization, neuroplasticity, and modularity of mind. Then Dr.\
  \ Cobb talks about the studies we did on the neurons of Drosophila maggots. Finally,\
  \ we talk about the questions that science can answer about consciousness, and also\
  \ the future of neuroscience.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:36  Where people located the\
