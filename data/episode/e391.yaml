shownotes: "<p>Dr. Matthew Cobb is Professor of Zoology at the University of Manchester,\
  \ where his research focuses on the sense of smell, insect behavior and the history\
  \ of science. He is also a historian of the French Resistance. He\u2019s the author\
  \ of several books, including The Idea of the Brain: A History.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we talk about The Idea of the Brain, and the history and approaches in\
  \ the discipline of neuroscience. We start with some of the history about where\
  \ people located the mind in the body, when we started locating mind in the brain,\
  \ and several different metaphors that researchers used in science. We discuss if\
  \ artificial intelligence can create good models of the mind/brain. We talk about\
  \ localization, neuroplasticity, and modularity of mind. Then Dr. Cobb talks about\
  \ the studies we did on the neurons of Drosophila maggots. Finally, we talk about\
  \ the questions that science can answer about consciousness, and also the future\
  \ of neuroscience.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Relevant links:</p>\n<p>Faculty page: <a href=\"\
