  \ Tennie is a Tenured Research Group Leader (\u201CTools and Culture among Early\
  \ Hominins\u201D) in the Department of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology at\
  \ the University of T\xFCbingen. In addition, he is an adjunct scientist at the\
  \ Lester E. Fisher Center for the Study and Conservation of Apes. His main research\
  \ triangulates what (if anything) makes human cognition unique - as well as why\
  \ (and relatedly, when this happened and how often). In particular, he uses various\
  \ methods and pathways to study the factors and the prehistorical beginnings that\
  \ enabled the typical modern human \"variant of culture\": cumulative culture of\
  \ know-how.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about ape culture. We start by defining\
  \ it, and discuss if it is similar or different to human culture. We talk about\
  \ studies done in captivity versus the ones done in the wild. We discuss the differences\
  \ between ape culture and human culture, and focus on supra-individual know-how.\
  \ We discuss what we can learn from these questions. We talk about the \u201Csimilarity\
  \ hypothesis\", and why is it important to study unenculturated and untrained apes.\
  \ We discuss the work of Cecilia Heyes and its potential implications for the study\
  \ of culture. We talk about tasks commonly used to study ape social learning, and\
  \ what we can learn from them. Finally, we discuss if we know where the differences\
  \ in the cultures between humans and apes come from.\n\nTime Links:\n00:00 Intro\n\
