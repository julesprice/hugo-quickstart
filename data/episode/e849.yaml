shownotes: "<p>Dr. Claudio Tennie is a Tenured Research Group Leader (\u201CTools\
  \ and Culture among Early Hominins\u201D) in the Department of Early Prehistory\
  \ and Quaternary Ecology at the University of T\xFCbingen. In addition, he is an\
  \ adjunct scientist at the Lester E. Fisher Center for the Study and Conservation\
  \ of Apes. His main research triangulates what (if anything) makes human cognition\
  \ unique - as well as why (and relatedly, when this happened and how often). In\
  \ particular, he uses various methods and pathways to study the factors and the\
  \ prehistorical beginnings that enabled the typical modern human &quot;variant of\
  \ culture&quot;: cumulative culture of know-how.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we talk about ape culture. We start by defining it, and discuss if it is similar\
  \ or different to human culture. We talk about studies done in captivity versus\
  \ the ones done in the wild. We discuss the differences between ape culture and\
  \ human culture, and focus on supra-individual know-how. We discuss what we can\
  \ learn from these questions. We talk about the \u201Csimilarity hypothesis&quot;,\
  \ and why is it important to study unenculturated and untrained apes. We discuss\
  \ the work of Cecilia Heyes and its potential implications for the study of culture.\
  \ We talk about tasks commonly used to study ape social learning, and what we can\
  \ learn from them. Finally, we discuss if we know where the differences in the cultures\
  \ between humans and apes come from.</p>\n"
