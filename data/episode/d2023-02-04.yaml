shownotes: '<p>This has been an amazing journey, and I thank you all very much for
  your support, and my guests for the great conversations.</p>

  <p>Your recent response was incredible, but since my last video, another dear patron
  of mine has been afflicted by financial issues/inflation and had to drop his generous
  support.</p>

  <p>This battle has not been won yet. I am now 20% away from the level of monthly
  support I was at before this crisis.</p>

  <p>So, I would like to ask you if you could be so generous as to help me walk the
  path back to a more secure financial place. We are getting there.</p>

  <p>For these past 5 years, I have been doing my best to promote scientific and philosophical
  literacy, and have released more than 730 interviews. I have had on top academics
  and intellectuals, but I also give a platform to academics in the early stages of
  their careers, and PhD students.</p>

  <p>And this is all made possible by you.</p>

  <p><br></p>
