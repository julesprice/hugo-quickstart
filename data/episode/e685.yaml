  Social Contract: Culture and Cooperation in Human Evolution.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on The Pleistocene Social Contract. We talk about aspects
  of the evolution of human social life, like the suppression of dominance hierarchies,
  direct and indirect reciprocation, cooperation, intergroup violence, cultural learning,
  human life history, and interactions between residential groups and rates of cultural
  innovation. We also discuss how human societies scale up, and the transition to
  agricultural societies, with hierarchy and inequality. Finally, we ask if this knowledge
  can be applied to social dynamics in industrialized societies.</p>
