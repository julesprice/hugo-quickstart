  \ in the Research School of Social Sciences at Australian National University and\
  \ Victoria University of Wellington. He is the winner of several international prizes\
  \ in the philosophy of science, and was previously editor of Biology and Philosophy.\

  \ of Science and Technology (2020-2023). He is the author of several books, including\
  \ The Pleistocene Social Contract: Culture and Cooperation in Human Evolution.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on The Pleistocene Social Contract. We talk about aspects\
  \ of the evolution of human social life, like the suppression of dominance hierarchies,\
  \ direct and indirect reciprocation, cooperation, intergroup violence, cultural\
  \ learning, human life history, and interactions between residential groups and\
  \ rates of cultural innovation. We also discuss how human societies scale up, and\
  \ the transition to agricultural societies, with hierarchy and inequality. Finally,\
  \ we ask if this knowledge can be applied to social dynamics in industrialized societies.\n\
