shownotes: "<p>Dr. Cecilia Heyes is a Professor of Psychology and Senior Research\
  \ Fellow in Theoretical Life Science at All Souls College, University of Oxford.\
  \ She was trained as an experimental psychologist at University College London (UCL,\
  \ 1978-84). As a Harkness Fellow in the United States (1984-6), she studied evolutionary\
  \ epistemology with Donald T. Campbell and philosophy of mind with Daniel Dennett.\
  \ She\u2019s done experimental work, initially in animal cognition and later in\
  \ cognitive neuroscience, and more recently her group developed and tested an associative\
  \ account of the origins of imitation and the mirror neuron system. She\u2019s the\
  \ author of Cognitive Gadgets: The Cultural Evolution of Thinking.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we talk about the approach developed by Dr. Cecilia Heyes and collaborators,\
  \ as exposed in her book, Cognitive Gadgets \u2013 cultural evolutionary theory.\
  \ First, we discuss what it borrows from Evolutionary Psychology and Cultural Evolutionary\
  \ Theory, and what assumptions from both of those fields it rejects. We talk about\
  \ modularity of mind, and then get into two of the cognitive mechanisms that Dr.\
  \ Heyes explores in the book, namely imitation and mindreading (or theory of mind).\
  \ We get a bit into how language might influence our thinking. And toward the end\
  \ we address issues regarding human nature, and evolutionary mismatch.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
