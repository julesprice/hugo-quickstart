  <p>In this episode, we focus on How the World Became Rich. We start by talking about
  how rich the world is now, and we also define economic growth. We then go through
  different explanations for sustained economic growth, including geography, institutions,
  culture, demographics, and colonization. We talk about how sustained economic growth
  was possible in northwestern Europe, and what led to the British industrial revolution.
  We talk about why China did not get there first. Finally, we discuss some of the
  drawbacks to economic growth, including climate change, deadly weapons, and economic
  inequality.</p>
