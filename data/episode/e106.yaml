  \ of Oregon Institute of Cognitive and Decision Sciences, and an affiliate of the\
  \ University of Oregon Anthropology Department. She is an evolutionary psychologist/anthropologist\
  \ who specializes in symbolic and aesthetic behavior, with an emphasis on storytelling,\
  \ art, and play. Her work investigates the origins of these behaviors\u2014specifically,\
  \ the selection pressures that led to their emergence, the role they played in ancestral\
  \ human societies, and the design features of the mind that make them possible.\
  \ She publishes in both scientific and humanities journals, and blogs for the Huffington\
  \ Post, where she explores modern issues, trends, and behaviors in light of human\
  \ evolutionary history.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about storytelling and\
  \ folklore from an evolutionary perspective. We start off by talking about the social\
  \ role and the evolutionary bases of storytelling. We then look into some of the\
  \ similarities in themes and characters across cultures. We discuss if storytelling\
  \ might play a role in the development of theory of mind in children. We also talk\
  \ about the role of play in children\u2019s development. And we end up talking about\
  \ some of the similarities between oral storytelling and fictional literature, and\
  \ the fact that storytelling still plays a big role in modern societies.</p>\n<p>Time\
