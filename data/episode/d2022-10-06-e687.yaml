  \ Department of Anthropology at Washington State University, where he studies long-distance\
  \ relationships and natural resource management in Tanzania in collaboration with\
  \ Anne Pisor and Monique Borgerhoff Mulder. This project applies evolutionary anthropology\

  \ fisheries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about human cooperation. We\
  \ start by talking about the aspects of human cooperation Dr. Smith focus the most\
  \ on. We discuss models of human evolution. We talk about partner choice models,\
  \ and the \u201Canomalous-is-bad\u201D stereotype. We also discuss if people prefer\
  \ deontologists or consequentialists when it comes to moral character. We discuss\
  \ long-distance relationships and resource management, and how people from different\
  \ groups maintain cooperation. Throughout the interview, we focus mostly on the\
  \ Hadza and people from Tanzania. Finally, we talk about human universals and cross-cultural\
  \ variation.</p>\n"
