shownotes: "<p>Dr. C\xE9cile Sarabian is a Postdoctoral researcher in Cognitive Ecology\
  \ at Kyoto University. She investigates parasite avoidance behaviors and their effectiveness\
  \ in non-human primates and other animals via field and lab experimentation/observations.\
  \ She is generally interested in the origins of hygiene and disgust in humans and\
  \ in the potential applications of disgust into the field of Conservation.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about disgust and conservation. We start by discussing\
  \ disgust from an evolutionary perspective. We talk about different disgust-related\
  \ behaviors, and hygiene. We mention briefly how an evolutionary perspective can\
  \ inform how people deal with the covid-19 pandemic, and how they react to pathogens\
  \ in this context. We delve into the discussion surrounding the different domains\
  \ of disgust (pathogen disgust, sexual disgust, and moral disgust). We also do a\
  \ bit of comparative psychology, and explore to what extent we can compare non-human\
  \ primates to us. We also talk about sex differences in disgust, and human universals\
  \ in disgust reactions. Finally, we talk about new avenues to explore when it comes\
  \ to the role disgust might play in animal conservation.</p>\n"
