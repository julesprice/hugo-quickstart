shownotes: "Dr. Michael Graziano is a Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at\
  \ Princeton University. His scientific research focuses on the brain basis of awareness.\
  \ He has proposed the \"attention schema\" theory, an explanation of how, and for\
  \ what adaptive advantage, brains attribute the property of awareness to themselves.\
  \ His previous work focused on how the cerebral cortex monitors the space around\
  \ the body and controls movement within that space. Notably he has suggested that\
  \ the classical map of the body in motor cortex, the homunculus, is not correct\
  \ and is better described as a map of complex actions that make up the behavioral\
  \ repertoire. He's also the author of 13 books, including Consciousness and the\
  \ Social Brain (2013), and The Spaces Between Us: A Story of Neuroscience, Evolution,\
  \ and Human Nature (2018).\n\nIn this episode, we focus our conversation on the\
  \ topic of consciousness. Basically, what is consciousness, from a scientific perspective,\
  \ and its relationship to other cognitive components of our brains. Also, the interplay\
  \ between attention, awareness, and consciousness. The evolutionary relevance of\
  \ consciousness for social species, and theory of mind. How we can tackle the hard\
  \ problem of consciousness. \u201CIllusionism\u201D, or consciousness as an illusion\
  \ of the mind. And, finally, we address the current limitations in studying consciousness\
  \ in other animals; if we are close to create conscious AI; and also Ant\xF3nio\
  \ Dam\xE1sio\u2019s proposal about how consciousness is build up from lower-order\
