shownotes: "<p>Dr. Michael Graziano is a Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience\
  \ at Princeton University. His scientific research focuses on the brain basis of\
  \ awareness. He has proposed the \"attention schema\" theory, an explanation of\
  \ how, and for what adaptive advantage, brains attribute the property of awareness\
  \ to themselves. His previous work focused on how the cerebral cortex monitors the\
  \ space around the body and controls movement within that space. Notably he has\
  \ suggested that the classical map of the body in motor cortex, the homunculus,\
  \ is not correct and is better described as a map of complex actions that make up\
  \ the behavioral repertoire. He's also the author of 13 books, including Consciousness\
  \ and the Social Brain (2013), and The Spaces Between Us: A Story of Neuroscience,\
  \ Evolution, and Human Nature (2018).</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus our conversation\
  \ on the topic of consciousness. Basically, what is consciousness, from a scientific\
  \ perspective, and its relationship to other cognitive components of our brains.\
  \ Also, the interplay between attention, awareness, and consciousness. The evolutionary\
  \ relevance of consciousness for social species, and theory of mind. How we can\
  \ tackle the hard problem of consciousness. \u201CIllusionism\u201D, or consciousness\
  \ as an illusion of the mind. And, finally, we address the current limitations in\
  \ studying consciousness in other animals; if we are close to create conscious AI;\
  \ and also Ant\xF3nio Dam\xE1sio\u2019s proposal to the wat consciousness is build\
  \ up from lower-order neurological processes.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:53\
