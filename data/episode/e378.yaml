shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 25th 2020.  \nDr. Brian Hare is a professor of evolutionary\
  \ anthropology at Duke University. He researches the evolution of cognition by studying\
  \ both humans, our close relatives the primates (especially bonobos and chimpanzees),\
  \ and species whose cognition converged with our own (primarily domestic dogs).\
  \ He founded and co-directs the Duke Canine Cognition Center. He\u2019s the author\
  \ of several books, including the most recent one, Survival of the Friendliest:\
  \ Understanding Our Origins and Rediscovering Our Common Humanity.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about his book, Survival of the Friendliest. First, we go through some\
  \ of the psychological mechanism that allow for our friendliness, and later we also\
  \ refer to empathy, self-control, and theory of mind. We discuss the process of\
  \ self-domestication. We also talk about simianization, Social Dominance Orientation\
  \ (SDO) and Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA), and ways to increase our friendliness\
  \ toward out-groups.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:53  The psychological ingredients for\
