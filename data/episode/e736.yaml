  \ it is measured. We discuss aspects of psychology that correlate with well-being,\
  \ like being future-oriented, having goals, and being a good person. We talk about\
  \ individual differences in personality traits, how people react to life events,\
  \ and changes in well-being across the lifespan. We discuss psychological strengths\
  \ and psychological flexibility. Finally, we talk about the link between well-being\
  \ and interpersonal relationships.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:31  What\
