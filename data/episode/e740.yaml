shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 25th 2023.  \nDr. Tibor Rutar is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Sociology at the University of Maribor, Slovenia, Researcher at the Center\
  \ for the Study of Post-Socialist Societies in Maribor, and Researcher at the Research\
  \ Center for Strategy and Governance at the University of Ljubljana. His scholarly\
  \ work is currently focused on political, economic and historical sociology, particularly\
  \ longstanding social issues related to democracy and capitalism. His lastest book\
  \ is Capitalism for Realists: Virtues and Vices of the Modern Economy (Routledge,\
  \ 2022).\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Capitalism for Realists. We start by defining\
  \ capitalism, and talk about people\u2019s current views on capitalism and socialism.\
  \ We discuss what Marx got wrong about capitalism, Marxist and libertarian perspectives,\
  \ and Dr. Rutar\u2019s approach. We talk about different explanations for the origins\
  \ of capitalism, from Weber, Henrich, and Mokyr; an alternative explanation for\
  \ its development in 15th and 16th-century England; and we also address explanations\
  \ based on cultural superiority. We get into topics like market exploitation and\
  \ the minimum wage; the relationship between capitalism and poverty; economic inequality;\
  \ the term \u201Cneoliberalism\u201D; and claims about the moral effects of markets.\
  \ Finally, we talk about climate change, and discuss if it is caused by capitalism.\n\
