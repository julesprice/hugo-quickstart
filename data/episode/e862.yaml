shownotes: "Dr. Lisa Bortolotti is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Birmingham,\
  \ affiliated with the Philosophy Department in the School of Philosophy, Theology,\
  \ and Religion; and with the Institute for Mental Health in the School of Psychology.\
  \ Her research is in the philosophy of the cognitive sciences. She is the author\
  \ of The Epistemic Innocence of Irrational Beliefs, and more recently, Why Delusions\
  \ Matter.\n\nThis is our second talk. You can watch the first one, on The Epistemic\
  \ Innocence of Irrational Beliefs, here: https://youtu.be/v13m30R_xbY\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on Why Delusions Matter. We start by defining delusions, and\
  \ the criteria used to classify them. We discuss if there are different types of\
  \ delusions, and if the term \u201Cdelusion\u201D is problematic. We talk about\
  \ what we learn about human cognition by studying delusions, the epistemic needs\
  \ they fulfill, personal identity, their social component, and their costs and benefits\
  \ to speakers and interpreters. We discuss how delusions exemplify the strengths\
  \ of human cognition, and implications for social and political epistemology. Finally,\
  \ we talk about creating better epistemic environments, and the issue of epistemic\
  \ responsibility.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:43  What are delusions? \
