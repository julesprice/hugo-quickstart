  \ of Psychology. Her research is in the philosophy of the cognitive sciences. She\
  \ is the author of The Epistemic Innocence of Irrational Beliefs, and more recently,\
  \ Why Delusions Matter.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Why Delusions\
  \ Matter. We start by defining delusions, and the criteria used to classify them.\
  \ We discuss if there are different types of delusions, and if the term \u201Cdelusion\u201D\
  \ is problematic. We talk about what we learn about human cognition by studying\
  \ delusions, the epistemic needs they fulfill, personal identity, their social component,\
  \ and their costs and benefits to speakers and interpreters. We discuss how delusions\
  \ exemplify the strengths of human cognition, and implications for social and political\
  \ epistemology. Finally, we talk about creating better epistemic environments, and\
  \ the issue of epistemic responsibility.</p>\n"
