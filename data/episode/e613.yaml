shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 20th 2022.  \nDr. Hannah K. Bradshaw is an assistant\
  \ professor in the Department of Psychology at Washington and Jefferson College.\
  \ Dr. Bradshaw is an interdisciplinary-minded psychologist who incorporates methodological\
  \ tools from social psychology, marketing, health psychology, industrial/organizational\
  \ psychology, and psychoneuroimmunology. Her research program explores how interpersonal\
  \ and ecological cues might affect our perceptions and decisions in the broader\
  \ social world. While she has a wide variety of research interests, she tends to\
  \ gravitate towards questions that pertain to disgust sensitivity, women\u2019s\
  \ sociality, and consumer preferences and behavior.\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about female beauty, beautification, economics and luxury products, and food choices.\
  \ We start by talking about why people value female beauty, and how it triggers\
  \ sexual competition. We get into appearance enhancement and beautification penalties.\
  \ We discuss the value of luxury goods in the context of economic scarcity, and\
  \ how women like status and earning capacity in men. We talk about women\u2019s\
  \ trust in female vs gay male sales\u2019 associates. Finally, we talk about why\
  \ people make unhealthy food choices, and how people other people who are willing\
  \ to try new foods, in terms of sexual unrestrictedness and desirability.\n\nTime\
