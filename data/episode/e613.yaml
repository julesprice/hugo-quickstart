  \ penalties. We discuss the value of luxury goods in the context of economic scarcity,\
  \ and how women like status and earning capacity in men. We talk about women\u2019\
  s trust in female vs gay male sales\u2019 associates. Finally, we talk about why\
  \ people make unhealthy food choices, and how people other people who are willing\
