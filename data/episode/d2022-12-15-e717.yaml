  <p>In this episode, we focus on DSM. We start with a bit of the history of Psychiatry,
  and how the first psychiatric diagnoses appeared. We talk about the creation of
  the DSM, and its cultural impact. We cover three interpretations of the DSM: scientific
  progress; harmful impacts; and the social perspective. We talk about how mental
  disorders are researched, and their characteristics. We get into the DSM-5, and
  its promises. We discuss the merits and shortcomings of a biological approach to
  mental disorders. Finally, we talk about the future of the DSM, its positive impact,
  and what should be changed.</p>
