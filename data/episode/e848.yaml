  \ Professor of Biology, of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, and of Neurosurgery\
  \ at Stanford University. Dr. Sapolsky is the author of several informative and\
  \ comical books that present cutting-edge psychoneurobiological knowledge in an\
  \ enjoyable, easy-to-read format. His latest book is Determined: A Science of Life\
  \ without Free Will.\n\nThis is our third interview. You can watch the first one\
  \ here: https://youtu.be/S9pqdKP9tuk. And the second one here: https://youtu.be/9q8h4C57mTw\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on Determined. We start by discussing the relationship\
  \ between the science of human behavior and questions regarding free will, and why\
  \ people believe in free will. We discuss whether it matters if we cannot fully\
  \ predict behavior yet. We talk about intent and premeditation, biology and the\
  \ environment, luck, and self-control. We discuss if people can choose the sort\
  \ of people they will become. We talk about the idea of meritocracy, and the roles\
  \ of blame, praise, and punishment. We discuss if hard determinists are bad people,\
  \ and whether we should refrain from making absolute claims regarding free will.\
  \ Finally, Dr. Sapolsky tells us what it would take for someone to convince him\
  \ that free will exists.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:36  Free will and the\
