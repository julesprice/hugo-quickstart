  \ Professor of Biology, of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, and of Neurosurgery\
  \ at Stanford University. Dr. Sapolsky is the author of several informative and\
  \ comical books that present cutting-edge psychoneurobiological knowledge in an\
  \ enjoyable, easy-to-read format. His latest book is Determined: A Science of Life\
  \ without Free Will.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Determined.\
  \ We start by discussing the relationship between the science of human behavior\
  \ and questions regarding free will, and why people believe in free will. We discuss\
  \ whether it matters if we cannot fully predict behavior yet. We talk about\nintent\
  \ and premeditation, biology and the environment, luck, and self-control. We discuss\
  \ if people can choose the sort of people they will become. We talk about the idea\
  \ of meritocracy, and the roles of blame, praise, and punishment. We discuss if\
  \ hard determinists are bad people, and whether we should refrain from making absolute\
  \ claims regarding free will. Finally, Dr. Sapolsky tells us what it would take\
  \ for someone to convince him that free will exists.</p>\n"
