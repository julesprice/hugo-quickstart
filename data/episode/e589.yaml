shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 8th 2021.  \nDr. Ashley Thomas is a postdoctoral\
  \ fellow at the center for research on open and equitable scholarship at MIT. She\
  \ is interested in humans as a social species. She investigates what infants, toddlers,\
  \ and children think about social relationships (i.e., their naive sociology). She\
  \ has studied how they think and feel about social hierarchy (i.e. situations where\
  \ there is a 'winner' and a 'loser' or when someone is 'in charge.'). Currently,\
  \ she is working with Elizabeth Spelke and Rebecca Saxe, and they are investigating\
  \ how infants interpret social interactions that involve their own caregivers as\
  \ well as how infants, toddlers, and children think about social intimacy. She has\
  \ also studied people's moral judgments of parenting decisions.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about developmental psychology. We focus a lot on children\u2019s na\xEF\
  ve sociology, and how they think about social relationships. We get into issues\
  \ surrounding social hierarchy, how children think about helpers and hinderers,\
  \ winners and losers, and low and high-ranking individuals. We talk about the kinds\
  \ of leaders children prefer. We discuss what children learn from social interactions\
  \ involving their own caregivers, and how they think about social intimacy. Finally,\
  \ we discuss the relation between people\u2019s theories of intelligence and beliefs\
  \ about brain development, and parenting.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:37\
