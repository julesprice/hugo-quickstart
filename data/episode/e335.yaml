shownotes: "RECORDED ON April 7th, 2020.  \nDr. Jeroen Hopster was a postdoctoral\
  \ researcher at Utrecht University, and now he is doing research on climate ethics\
  \ at the University of Graz. In February 2019 he defended his dissertation 'Moral\
  \ Objectivity: Origins and Foundations'. \n\nIn this episode, we focus mostly on\
  \ moral realism. We ask what it really is about, and what an evolutionary perspective\
  \ brings to the table. We also discuss in what ways morality can be objective. And\
  \ we deal with specific applied ethics topics, like climate ethics, the ethics of\
  \ pandemics applied specifically to covid-19, and animal rights.\n\nTime Links:\
