  \ and now he is doing research on climate ethics at the University of Graz. In February\

  <p>In this episode, we focus mostly on moral realism. We ask what it really is about,\
  \ and what an evolutionary perspective brings to the table. We also discuss in what\
  \ ways morality can be objective. And we deal with specific applied ethics topics,\
  \ like climate ethics, the ethics of pandemics applied specifically to covid-19,\
  \ and animal rights.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Hopster\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty\
