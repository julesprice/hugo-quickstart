  <p><br></p>\n<p>Dr. Laith Al-Shawaf is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the\
  \ University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS). Before, he was an Assistant Professor\
  \ at Bilkent University in Turkey and the youngest Visiting Fellow at the Institute\
  \ for Advanced Study in Berlin, Germany. Laith has worked as a statistical consultant\
  \ for an online dating company, has taught and conducted research in several different\
  \ countries, and is a member of the Arab-German Young Academy (AGYA), as well as\
  \ an academic adviser at Ideas Beyond Borders (IBB).</p>\n<p>In this episode, we\
  \ go through some of the theoretical foundations of Evolutionary Psychology. We\
  \ first tackle some misconceptions, like the one about \u201Cjust-so stories\u201D\
  , how biological mechanisms are designed, genetic determinism, and adaptations.\
  \ We then talk about how hypotheses are generated in Evolutionary Psychology, the\
  \ focus of the discipline on psychological mechanisms and not so much on manifest\
  \ behavior, and the importance of Tinbergen\u2019s 4 Questions. We also discuss\
  \ learning, context and environment in Evolutionary Psychology. Finally, we address\
  \ the issue of individual differences, and if we can make predictions about how\
  \ our psychology will evolve in the future.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Al-Shawaf\u2019\
