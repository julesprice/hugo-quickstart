shownotes: "<p>Dr. Daisy Dixon is a philosopher of art and an artist, and a Lecturer\
  \ in Philosophy at Cardiff University. Her research falls at the intersection of\
  \ philosophy of art, philosophy of language, and political philosophy. She explores\
  \ how visual art behaves like speech, and how curators and interpreters can affect\
  \ what an artwork communicates to its audience. Her current project concerns unjust\
  \ aesthetics and aesthetic injustice, focusing on artistic hate speech, aesthetic\
  \ \u2018counterspeech\u2019, and deceptive art. Her teaching interests span aesthetics,\
  \ philosophy of language, ethics, and feminist philosophy. She is also a practicing\
  \ artist in paint and sound.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we go through topics\
  \ at the intersection of philosophy of art and political philosophy. We start by\
  \ discussing what it means for an artwork to have meaning, if it makes sense to\
  \ think that it would have one single meaning independent of context, the influence\
  \ of culture, how meaning changes over time, and the role that curators play. We\
  \ talk about how artworks can be speech acts, and how art can lie. We discuss artistic\
  \ hate speech, the political role that art can play, and aesthetic counterspeech\
  \ as an alternative to censorship. We then discuss immoral artists, how we can determine\
  \ that an artist is morally problematic, and we should deal with their artworks.\
  \ Finally, we talk about politics and ethics of museums.</p>\n"
