shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 13th 2021.  \nDr. Benjamin M. Friedman is the William\
  \ Joseph Maier Professor of Political Economy, and formerly Chairman of the Department\
  \ of Economics, at Harvard University. He joined the Harvard faculty in 1972. Dr\
  \ Friedman\u2019s newest book is Religion and the Rise of Capitalism \u2013 a fundamental\
  \ reassessment of the foundations of current-day economics, showing how religious\
  \ thinking has shaped economic thinking ever since the beginnings of modern Western\
  \ economics and how this influence continues to be relevant today especially in\
  \ the United States. His two other general interest books have been The Moral Consequences\
  \ of Economic Growth (Knopf) and Day of Reckoning: The Consequences of American\
  \ Economic Policy Under Reagan and After (Random House).\n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ focus on Religion and the Rise of Capitalism. We get first into a bit of the early\
  \ history of economics. We focus a lot on David Hume and Adam Smith, and also in\
  \ how economic thinking changed after them. We talk about some of the most influential\
  \ schools of thinking in economics during the 19th and 20th centuries. We discuss\
  \ the political influence of the evangelical protestants in the US. We also talk\
  \ about the relationship between capitalism and political ideology, like liberalism\
  \ and conservatism. Finally, we discuss if there is any contradiction between the\
  \ promotion of cooperation by religion, and the competitive nature of capitalism,\
  \ and if we would have ever have modern Western economic thinking without Protestantism.\n\
