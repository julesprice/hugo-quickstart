shownotes: "<p>Dr. David Sloan Wilson is SUNY Distinguished Professor Emeritus of\
  \ Biology and Anthropology at Binghamton University. His books include Darwin\u2019\
  s Cathedral: Evolution, Religion, and the Nature of Society; and This View of Life:\
  \ Completing the Darwinian Revolution.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on religion\
  \ and multilevel selection. We start by talking about religion from an evolutionary\
  \ perspective, its functions, and its individual benefits. We discuss the New Atheists\u2019\
  \ take on religion, and the idea of \u201Catheism as stealth religion\u201D. We\
  \ also talk about group selection (cultural and genetic), how it works, its relationship\
  \ with kin selection, and why so many biologists dismiss it. Throughout the conversation\
  \ we mention multilevel selection. We also discuss policy as a branch of biology,\
  \ the eight core design principles for groups and institutions. Finally, we discuss\
  \ if it will ever be possible to plan societies.</p>\n"
