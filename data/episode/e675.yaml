shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 8th 2022.  \nDr. David Sloan Wilson is SUNY Distinguished\
  \ Professor Emeritus of Biology and Anthropology at Binghamton University. He applies\
  \ evolutionary theory to all aspects of humanity in addition to the rest of life,\
  \ both in his own research and as director of the Evolution Institute, a unique\
  \ campus-wide evolutionary studies program that recently received NSF funding to\
  \ expand into a nationwide consortium. His books include Darwin\u2019s Cathedral:\
  \ Evolution, Religion, and the Nature of Society; and This View of Life: Completing\
  \ the Darwinian Revolution.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on religion and multilevel\
  \ selection. We start by talking about religion from an evolutionary perspective,\
  \ its functions, and its individual benefits. We discuss the New Atheists\u2019\
  \ take on religion, and the idea of \u201Catheism as stealth religion\u201D. We\
  \ also talk about group selection (cultural and genetic), how it works, its relationship\
  \ with kin selection, and why so many biologists dismiss it. Throughout the conversation,\
  \ we mention multilevel selection. We also discuss policy as a branch of biology,\
  \ the eight core design principles for groups and institutions. Finally, we discuss\
  \ if it will ever be possible to plan societies.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro \
