  \ cognition group, at the Cognitive Science Department of the \xC9cole Normale Superieure\
  \ \u2013 PSL. She is a behavioral scientist studying the evolutionary and cognitive\
  \ determinants of social cognition. She has mainly focused on the way motivational\
  \ factors affect people\u2019s social behaviors.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we talk about individual differences in social cognition. We start by discussing\
  \ what they are, and how they are studied, including behavioral tasks and surveys.\
  \ We discuss how statistical \u201Cnoise\u201D can be meaningful. We talk about\
  \ the psychological effects of living in harsh and unpredictable environments in\
  \ the domains of cooperation and trust, health issues, political attitudes, and\
  \ parental investment. We discuss how we can reframe the way we think about the\
  \ psychology and behavior of people living in harsh environments. We talk about\
  \ how cognitive science can contribute to climate change mitigation. Finally, we\
  \ discuss what studying social cognition can teach us about reducing inequalities\
  \ in higher education.</p>\n"
