shownotes: "<p>Dr. Daniel Blumstein is a Professor in the Department of Ecology and\
  \ Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a Professor\
  \ at UCLA\u2019s Institute of the Environment and Sustainability. He is a behavioral\
  \ ecologist broadly interested in the evolution of behavior and the application\
  \ of behavioral and evolutionary principles to policy, health, and defense. He is\
  \ the author of books like A Primer of Conservation Behavior, The Failure of Environmental\
  \ Education (And How We Can Fix It), and The Nature of Fear: Survival Lessons from\
  \ the Wild.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about predator-prey research. We get\
  \ first into antipredator behavior, and how it influences sociality, and we talk\
  \ specifically about alarm calling and escape strategies. We then talk about arms\
  \ races between predators and prey, and the sociality of predator species. Finally,\
  \ we discuss how knowledge about animal behavior, with a focus on antipredator behavior,\
  \ might play a role in the conservation of species.</p>\n"
