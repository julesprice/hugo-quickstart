shownotes: "<p>Dr. Agust\xEDn Fuentes is Professor of Anthropology at Princeton University.\
  \ His research focuses on the biosocial, delving into the entanglement of biological\
  \ systems with the social and cultural lives of humans, our ancestors, and a few\
  \ of the other animals with whom humanity shares close relations. He is the author\
  \ of books like Race, Monogamy, and Other Lies They Told You, and Why We Believe.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about the origins of patriarchy. We start by defining\
  \ patriarchy, and talk about how long it has existed for. We talk about the idea\
  \ of the \u201Cnaturalness\u201D of patriarchy, and we discuss the different sources\
  \ of evidence used to support it, including animal models; the \u201Cnuclear family\u201D\
  , and cooperative breeding; pair bonding and mating systems; polygamy; morphological\
  \ correlates of male dominance; and sex differences in tool making and use. We talk\
  \ about what might be the best explanations for the origins of patriarchy. Finally,\
  \ we discuss how scientists are influenced by their own (political) values.</p>\n"
