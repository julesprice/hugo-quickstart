  \ THE CONNECTION WAS A BIT WEAK.</p>\n<p>Dr. Tyler Volk is Professor of Biology\
  \ and Environmental Studies at New York University. His areas of interest include\
  \ principles of form and function in systems (described as metapatterns), environmental\
  \ challenges to global prosperity, CO2 and global change, biosphere theory and the\
  \ role of life in earth dynamics. Dr. Volk has authored seven books, most recently,\
  \ Quarks to Culture: How We Came to Be. His previous books include: CO2 Rising:\
  \ The World\u2019s Greatest Environmental Challenge, What is Death?: A Scientist\
  \ Looks at the Cycle of Life, Gaia's Body: Toward a Physiology of Earth, and Metapatterns:\
  \ Across Space, Time, and Mind.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Dr. Volk\u2019\
  s book, Quarks to Culture. We talk about the fundamental levels, from fundamental\
  \ quanta to geopolitical states, and the three dynamical realms of physical laws,\
  \ biological evolution, and cultural evolution. We also refer to the concepts of\
  \ combogenesis and the alphakit, to understand how we move from one level to the\
  \ next. Toward the end, we also discuss how we might be able to move beyond the\
  \ level of geopolitical states.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Volk\u2019s work:</p>\n\
