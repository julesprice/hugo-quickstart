shownotes: "RECORDED ON March 27th, 2020.  \nDr. Jeffrey Barrett is Chancellor\u2019\
  s Professor of Logic and Philosophy of Science at the University of California,\
  \ Irvine. His current research involves two general topics. First, he is interested\
  \ in attempts to resolve the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. Second, he\
  \ is interested in using decision theory and evolutionary game theory to model basic\
  \ features of empirical and mathematical inquiry. In particular, he has been modeling\
  \ the coevolution of descriptive language and predictive theory in the context of\
  \ Skyrms-Lewis sender-receiver games. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about the philosophy\
  \ of quantum mechanics. First, Dr. Barrett walks us through some of its theoretical\
  \ bases, and its history starting in the 19th century. We also take the time to\
  \ talk a bit about how we know something is real in science. Then, we discuss a\
  \ series of issues and formulations in quantum mechanics, like the measurement problem,\
  \ the Single-Mind formulation, the Many-Worlds hypothesis, and the Many-Minds formulation\
  \ of quantum mechanics. We also refer to string theory, and some of its mains problems\
  \ and limitations. Finally, we ask if quantum mechanics forces us to accept the\
  \ nature of the world as probabilistic and/or random, and also if we can predict\
  \ human behavior with Physics theories.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:55  What is quantum\
