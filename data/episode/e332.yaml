shownotes: "<p>Dr. Jeffrey Barrett is Chancellor\u2019s Professor of Logic and Philosophy\
  \ of Science at the University of California, Irvine. His current research involves\
  \ two general topics. First, he is interested in attempts to resolve the measurement\
  \ problem in quantum mechanics. Second, he is interested in using decision theory\
  \ and evolutionary game theory to model basic features of empirical and mathematical\
  \ inquiry. In particular, he has been modeling the coevolution of descriptive language\
  \ and predictive theory in the context of Skyrms-Lewis sender-receiver games.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about the philosophy of quantum mechanics. First, Dr.\
  \ Barrett walks us through some of its theoretical bases, and its history starting\
  \ in the 19th century. We also take the time to talk a bit about how we know something\
  \ is real in science. Then, we discuss a series of issues and formulations in quantum\
  \ mechanics, like the measurement problem, the Single-Mind formulation, the Many-Worlds\
  \ hypothesis, and the Many-Minds formulation of quantum mechanics. We also refer\
  \ to string theory, and some of its mains problems and limitations. Finally, we\
  \ ask if quantum mechanics forces us to accept the nature of the world as probabilistic\
  \ and/or random, and also if we can predict human behavior with Physics theories.</p>\n\
