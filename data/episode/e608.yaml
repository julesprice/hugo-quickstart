shownotes: "<p>Dr. Moshe Hoffman is a Research Scientist at the Max Planck Institute\
  \ for Evolutionary Biology and Lecturer at Harvard's Department of Economics.</p>\n\
  <p>Dr. Erez Yoeli is a research scientist at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management,\
  \ where he directs the Applied Cooperation Team (ACT). His research focuses on altruism:\
  \ understanding how it works and how to promote it.</p>\n<p>They are both authors\
  \ of Hidden Games: The Surprising Power of Game Theory to Explain Irrational Human\
  \ Behavior.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Hidden Games. Topics include: aspects\
  \ of human behavior that game theory explains; motives and incentives, and why we\
  \ are oblivious to them; how learning shapes beliefs and tastes; rationality; spillovers;\
  \ primary and secondary rewards; proximate vs ultimate analyses; the emic-etic distinction;\
  \ Nash equilibrium; human cooperation; norms and punishment; why we process information\
  \ according to game-theoretic principles; moral philosophy from a game-theoretic\
  \ perspective; nudges; and beliefs, and where they come from.</p>\n"
