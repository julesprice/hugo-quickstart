  \nDr. Colin McGinn has taught philosophy at institutions of higher learning including\
  \ University College London, Rutgers University, and Oxford University. He\u2019\
  s the author of over two dozen books including The Character of Mind, Consciousness\
  \ and Its Objects, and The Making of a Philosopher, and he has also written for\
  \ the London Review of Books, The New Republic, Wall Street Journal, The New York\
  \ Review of Books, and other publications. \n\nIn this episode, I talk with Dr.\
  \ McGinn about minds and consciousness. More specifically, about what is a mind;\
  \ the different types of minds; how to avoid dualism; if the phenomenology of consciousness\
  \ can be scientifically explained; the continuity of mental capacities between animals;\
  \ a couple of science fiction proposals, like creating conscious machines, and mind\
  \ uploading; and animal rights.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:54  Types of minds        \n\
