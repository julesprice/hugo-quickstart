  <p>In this episode, we focus on Evolution, Morality and the Fabric of Society. We
  first talk about a social contract theory of morality, evolutionary reproductive
  success, kin selection and reciprocal altruism, and the role of rational deliberation.
  We go through three derived principles of inclusion, individual sovereignty (liberty),
  and equality, and social issues like patriarchy, individual sovereignty and copulatory
  choices, and overpopulation and extinction. Finally, we ask if an evolutionary account
  of human morality commits us to moral anti-realism.</p>
