shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 9th 2022.  \nDr. Todd Kashdan is Professor of Psychology\
  \ at George Mason University. He has been named Distinguished Faculty Member of\
  \ the Year at George Mason University and received the American Psychological Association's\
  \ Distinguished Scientific Award for Early Career Contribution to Psychology. His\
  \ new book is The Art of Insubordination: How to Dissent and Defy Effectively.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on The Art of Insubordination. We start by defining\
  \ insubordination. We discuss conformity, its relationship to personality and intelligence,\
  \ and the Asch and Milgram studies. We talk about principled insubordination, and\
  \ what characterizes it. We discuss the benefits of conformity. We talk about the\
  \ nature and nurture aspects behind being a dissenter. We discuss how to be a successful\
  \ subordinate, how to seek allies, and how to deal with distress. We talk about\
  \ what rebels should do when they acquire power, if they do not want to become tyrannical\
  \ themselves. We discuss how to create a culture that promotes viewpoint diversity.\
  \ We talk about the benefits of having insubordinates in society. Finally, we discuss\
  \ when insubordination is too much.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n01:04  What\
