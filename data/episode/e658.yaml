  <p>In this episode, we focus on The Art of Insubordination. We start by defining
  insubordination. We discuss conformity, its relationship to personality and intelligence,
  and the Asch and Milgram studies. We talk about principled insubordination, and
  what characterizes it. We discuss the benefits of conformity. We talk about the
  nature and nurture aspects behind being a dissenter. We discuss how to be a successful
  subordinate, how to seek allies, and how to deal with distress. We talk about what
  rebels should do when they acquire power, if they do not want to become tyrannical
  themselves. We discuss how to create a culture that promotes viewpoint diversity.
  We talk about the benefits of having insubordinates in society. Finally, we discuss
  when insubordination is too much.</p>
