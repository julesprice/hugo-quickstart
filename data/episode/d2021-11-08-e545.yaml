  <p>In this episode, we focus on The Language of Thieves. We talk about the origins
  of Rotwelsch, how it was influenced by other languages, the identity of the people
  who spoke it, and its social functions. We also discuss its relationship with the
  Nazi regime, and how Rotwelsch-speaking people were persecuted by the Nazis. Finally,
  we talk about what can we learn about a specific language by studying the history
  of its names, and what Rotwelsch can tell us about the development and evolution
  of other languages.</p>
