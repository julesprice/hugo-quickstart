shownotes: "Dr. Neil Levy is Senior Research Fellow at the Oxford Uehiro Centre for\
  \ Practical Ethics. He is a wide-ranging philosopher, working principally at the\
  \ intersection of philosophy of mind and psychology and ethics. He is the author\
  \ of several books, including Bad Beliefs: Why They Happen to Good People.\n\nIn\
  \ this episode, we focus on Bad Beliefs. We start by discussing what are rational\
  \ beliefs, and concepts like higher-order evidence, and the epistemic environment.\
  \ We discuss why sometimes people express beliefs they don\u2019t really hold. We\
  \ talk about how levels of intelligence and education predispose people to holding\
  \ inaccurate beliefs, and the role played by political ideology. We talk about individual\
  \ cognition, group deliberation, and knowledge as a social phenomenon. We ask if\
  \ the \u201Csolitary genius\u201D is a myth, and if people really have \u201Cbelief\
  \ systems\u201D. We talk about belief revision, and how beliefs are shallow. We\
  \ discuss the social and institutional cues on which beliefs depend. We also get\
  \ into virtue epistemology, critical thinking, and nudging. Finally, we discuss\
  \ if people respond to evidence, and if humans are rational.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
