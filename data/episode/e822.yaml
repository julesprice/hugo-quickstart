  \ and patience. We start with generosity, and discuss the distinction between generous\
  \ actions, acting from generosity, and being a generous person. We also discuss\
  \ if generous actions need to be costly, why motivation matters, if the action needs\
  \ to be freely done, what makes someone a generous person, and how generous we tend\
  \ to be. We then get into patience, and talk about the importance of goals, time,\
  \ emotions, and motivation in patience. We also address general questions about\
  \ the virtues, including what they are really about \u2013 character, or the good\
  \ they bring to other people -; the difference between continence and virtue; and\
  \ moral and epistemic/intellectual virtues.\n--</p>\n"
