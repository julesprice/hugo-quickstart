  <p>In this episode, we focus on Self-Improvement. We start by talking about the\
  \ philosophical history behind the culture of self-improvement. We discuss how we\
  \ present ourselves on social media, and the idea of \u201Cauthenticity\u201D. We\
  \ talk about spiritual narcissism, and the current popularity of stoicism. We discuss\
  \ how we obsess with self-improvement, and ignore collective solutions and political\
  \ and socioeconomic issues. We talk about self-improvement as a means of class signaling,\
  \ and \u201Ctechnosolutionist\u201D approaches involving transhumanism and self-enhancement.\
  \ We discuss how neoliberalism ties to self-improvement ideas, and how obsessed\
  \ we are with being productive. Finally, we talk about how we can reframe self-improvement,\
  \ and a positive role for technology.</p>\n"
