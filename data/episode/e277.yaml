shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 22nd, 2019.  \nAaron Rabinowitz is an Adjunct Professor\
  \ (PTL) in the Rutgers Philosophy department and the Rutgers Honors College. He\
  \ specializes in ethics, metaethics, and AI. His work focuses on developing a secular\
  \ moral realism that is compatible with the problem of moral luck. He also hosts\
  \ two philosophy podcasts: Philosophers in Space and Embrace the Void. The goal\
  \ of both shows is to make philosophy accessible for everyone, using science fiction\
  \ and existential horror.\n\nIn this episode, we discuss metaethics, and moral realism.\
  \ We first go through the definitions of moral realism and objective morality. Then\
  \ we get into several different issues, like our conflicting moral intuitions, moral\
  \ foundations, and the limitations of our evolved morality. We also talk about moral\
  \ nihilism, and moral relativism. We discuss the differences between knowledge produced\
  \ by science and moral truths (and value judgments). In the latter part of the conversation,\
  \ we discuss to what extent moral axioms also apply to people\u2019s decisions about\
  \ their own wellbeing; the fact that we don\u2019t have direct access to other people\u2019\
  s minds and its moral implications, when it comes to paternalism; and also to what\
  \ extent we should care about how we treat other animals and, in the future, advanced\
  \ AI systems.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:11  Can Aaron convince me that moral realism\
  \ is right?  \n02:46  What is moral realism?  \n03:54  What does \u201Cobjective\u201D\
  \ mean in morality?   \n08:48  How can we arrive at moral truths?   \n13:08  The\
  \ problem with conflicting ethical systems  \n17:17  Is morality just about preferences\
  \ and intuitions?   \n22:31  People with different moral foundations  \n29:43  Evolutionary\
  \ psychology, and our complicated evolved morality  \n35:24  If moral truths are\
  \ instantiated in the Universe, where do they come from?  \n37:50  What about moral\
  \ nihilists, and moral relativists?  \n43:45  Are moral truths equivalent to scientific\
  \ truths?  \n46:49  We are stuck with our evolved moral epistemology  \n57:09  Should\
  \ we take seriously people deciding on moral truths by voting?  \n1:03:50  Do moral\
  \ truths also apply to how people deal with their own wellbeing?  \n1:10:08  We\
  \ don\u2019t have direct access to other people\u2019s minds  \n1:14:15  How should\
  \ we treat advanced AI systems (and other animals)?  \n1:20:27  Closing statements\
