shownotes: "<p>Aaron Rabinowitz is an Adjunct Professor (PTL) in the Rutgers Philosophy\
  \ department and the Rutgers Honors College. He specializes in ethics, metaethics,\
  \ and AI. His work focuses on developing a secular moral realism that is compatible\
  \ with the problem of moral luck. He also hosts two philosophy podcasts: Philosophers\
  \ in Space and Embrace the Void. The goal of both shows is to make philosophy accessible\
  \ for everyone, using science fiction and existential horror.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we discuss metaethics, and moral realism. We first go through the definitions\
  \ of moral realism and objective morality. Then we get into several different issues,\
  \ like our conflicting moral intuitions, moral foundations, and the limitations\
  \ of our evolved morality. We also talk about moral nihilism, and moral relativism.\
  \ We discuss the differences between knowledge produced by science and moral truths\
  \ (and value judgments). In the latter part of the conversation, we discuss to what\
  \ extent moral axioms also apply to people\u2019s decisions about their own wellbeing;\
  \ the fact that we don\u2019t have direct access to other people\u2019s minds and\
  \ its moral implications, when it comes to paternalism; and also to what extent\
  \ we should care about how we treat other animals and, in the future, advanced AI\
  \ systems.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Aaron\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Philosophers in\
