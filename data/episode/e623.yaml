shownotes: "<p>Dr. Leonard Newman is Associate Professor of Psychology at Syracuse\
  \ University. At the broadest level, Dr. Newman\u2019s research focuses on the motivational\
  \ aspects of social cognition. More specific interests include dehumanization, social\
  \ stigma, defensive and self-protective processes in judgment and memory, and the\
  \ social psychology of genocide and mass killing.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk\
  \ about issues in social psychology. We talk about the self-concept, and how people\
  \ deal with threats to it. We discuss how people react to their own violations of\
  \ moral standards. We talk about dispositional, situational, and interactionist\
  \ explanations of wrongdoing, and cross-cultural variation in people\u2019s attitudes\
  \ toward them. We explore attitudinal ambivalence and pluralistic ignorance. Finally,\
  \ we talk about how preferred beliefs influence skepticism about psychological findings.</p>\n"
