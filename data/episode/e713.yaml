shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 7th 2022.  \nLucy Cooke is a New York Times best-selling\
  \ author, award-winning documentary filmmaker and broadcaster, National Geographic\
  \ explorer and TED talker with a Masters in Zoology from the University of Oxford.\
  \ Her latest book is Bitch: On the Female of the Species.\n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ focus on Bitch. We start by discussing the difference between sex and gender,\
  \ and where assumptions regarding the female sex come from. We talk about behavioral\
  \ sex differences, how sex is defined, and hormones. We go through sexual selection,\
  \ what females gain by mating with multiple partners, and the cost of sperm. We\
  \ talk about how the study of the female genitalia has been neglected. We discuss\
  \ if the female orgasm is an adaptation, and if there really is such a thing as\
  \ a \u201Cmaternal instinct\u201D. We talk about mother-offspring conflict, and\
  \ female intrasexual competition. We discuss primate societies, phylogenetic comparisons,\
  \ and animal matriarchies. We talk about menopause and grandmothers. We discuss\
  \ asexual reproduction, and if the Y chromosome is disappearing. Finally, we talk\
  \ about the origins of gender inequality, and what needs to be revised in the field\
  \ of evolutionary biology.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:38  Distinguishing\
