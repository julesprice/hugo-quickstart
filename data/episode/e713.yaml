shownotes: "<p>Lucy Cooke is a New York Times best-selling author, award-winning documentary\
  \ filmmaker and broadcaster, National Geographic explorer and TED talker with a\
  \ Masters in Zoology from the University of Oxford. Her latest book is Bitch: A\
  \ Revolutionary Guide to Sex, Evolution and the Female Animal.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we focus on Bitch. We start by discussing the difference between sex and gender,\
  \ and where assumptions regarding the female sex come from. We talk about behavioral\
  \ sex differences, and how sex is defined. We go through sexual selection, and what\
  \ females gain by mating with multiple partners. We talk about how the study of\
  \ female genitalia has been neglected. We discuss if the female orgasm is an adaptation,\
  \ and if there really is such a thing as a \u201Cmaternal instinct\u201D. We talk\
  \ about mother-offspring conflict, and female intrasexual competition. We discuss\
  \ primate societies, and phylogenetic comparisons. We talk about menopause and grandmothers.\
  \ We discuss asexual reproduction, and if the Y chromosome is disappearing. Finally,\
  \ we talk about the origins of gender inequality, and what needs to be revised in\
  \ the field of evolutionary biology.</p>\n"
