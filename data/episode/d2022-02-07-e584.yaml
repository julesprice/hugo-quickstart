  <p>In this episode, we focus on Why It\u2019s OK to Make Bad Choices. We first discuss\
  \ how we determine that a particular choice is a bad one. We talk about paternalism\
  \ \u2013 coercive and libertarian. We discuss matters related to free will, and\
  \ State regulations. We talk about the potential life benefits of making bad choices,\
  \ and if people should care about their effects on others. We discuss if there are\
  \ cases where other people should interfere. Finally, Dr. Glod tells us if, generally\
  \ speaking, it is OK for people to make bad choices.</p>\n"
