  <p>In this episode, we talk about scientism. We start by defining scientism, and\
  \ its relationship to science. We go through many different questions like \u201C\
  What is reality?\u201D, the evolution of human psychology, purpose and meaning,\
  \ belief, consciousness, free will, God, the nature of morality, and moral progress.\
  \ We talk about nihilism, and its relationship with scientism. Finally, we discuss\
  \ how scientism could apply to the social sciences, how to deal with the humanities,\
  \ and atheism.</p>\n"
