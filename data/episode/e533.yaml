  \ Gets Things Wrong.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about scientism. We start by defining\
  \ scientism, and its relationship to science. We go through many different questions\
  \ like \u201CWhat is reality?\u201D, the evolution of human psychology, purpose\
  \ and meaning, belief, consciousness, free will, God, the nature of morality, and\
  \ moral progress. We talk about nihilism, and its relationship with scientism. Finally,\
  \ we discuss how scientism could apply to the social sciences, how to deal with\
  \ the humanities, and atheism.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:32  What is\
