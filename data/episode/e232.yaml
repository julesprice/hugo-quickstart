  s recent book, Positive Evolutionary Psychology. We talk about the history and the\
  \ topics of interest of the field of Positive Psychology, and what Evolutionary\
  \ Psychology adds to the picture. We address a potential criticism, having to do\
  \ with Positive Evolutionary Psychology being a scientific field with a moral goal.\
  \ Then we get into the nitty-gritty of the thesis of the book, and talk about the\
  \ importance of integrating the negative aspects of our psychology; considering\
  \ individual differences; the issue of evolutionary mismatch; politics; religion;\
  \ our evolved morality, and how we can expand our moral circles; and the literature\
  \ on estrangements and the importance of making amends. Dr. Geher leaves us with\
  \ some remarks on the nefarious aspects of modern technology.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Buy\
