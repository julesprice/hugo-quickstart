shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 30TH, 2019.  \nDr. Glenn Geher is Professor of Psychology\
  \ at the State University of New York at New Paltz where he has been awarded SUNY\
  \ Chancellor Awards for Excellence for both Teaching and Research. In addition to\
  \ teaching various courses and directing the New Paltz Evolutionary Psychology Lab,\
  \ Dr. Geher serves as founding director of the campus\u2019 Evolutionary Studies\
  \ (EvoS) program. He is also credited as the founder of the NorthEastern Evolutionary\
  \ Psychology Society (NEEPS). He has also published several books including Evolutionary\
  \ Psychology 101, Mating Intelligence Unleashed: The Role of the Mind in Sex, Dating,\
  \ and Love, and Straightforward Statistics. In Darwin's Subterranean World: Evolution,\
  \ Mind, and Mating Intelligence, his Psychology Today blog, Dr. Geher addresses\
  \ various topics related to the human condition. He has recently released a new\
  \ book, Positive Evolutionary Psychology: Darwin's Guide to Living a Richer Life.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on Dr. Geher\u2019s recent book, Positive Evolutionary\
  \ Psychology. We talk about the history and the topics of interest of the field\
  \ of Positive Psychology, and what Evolutionary Psychology adds to the picture.\
  \ We address a potential criticism, having to do with Positive Evolutionary Psychology\
  \ being a scientific field with a moral goal. Then we get into the nitty-gritty\
  \ of the thesis of the book, and talk about the importance of integrating the negative\
  \ aspects of our psychology; considering individual differences; the issue of evolutionary\
  \ mismatch; politics; religion; our evolved morality, and how we can expand our\
  \ moral circles; and the literature on estrangements and the importance of making\
  \ amends. Dr. Geher leaves us with some remarks on the nefarious aspects of modern\
  \ technology. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:17  The history of Positive Psychology  \n12:28\
