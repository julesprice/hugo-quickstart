  \ University of York. She holds degrees in Philosophy from Yale, Oxford and Princeton\
  \ and has taught in the USA, Canada, and Germany. Dr. Wilson teaches and writes\

  \ the entire conversation revolves around the major topics covered in Dr. Wilson\u2019\
  s book, Moral Animals. We start with an exploration of the sources of morality,\
  \ from primatology to science. We then move on to talk about some forms of morality,\
  \ like moral realism, moral relativism, and Rawls\u2019 veil of ignorance. And we\
  \ end up with a discussion of some topics like egalitarianism, feminism, meritocracy,\
  \ and income inequality.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:52 The role of our evolved\
