shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 5th 2022.  \nDr. Quentin Atkinson is a Professor\
  \ in Psychology at the University of Auckland, where he runs the Language, Cognition\
  \ and Culture Lab, and co-Director of the University of Auckland Behavioural Insights\
  \ Exchange (UoABIX). He uses lab and field experiments, computer modelling and evolutionary\
  \ theory to shed light on the evolution of human culture and cognition. This work\
  \ answers questions including the origins of linguistic diversity, the function\
  \ of religion, the psychology of climate change, how evolved cognitive biases shape\
  \ our social behavior and why political systems vary the way they do around the\
  \ globe.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about politics, culture, and religion. We first\
  \ talk about the cultural foundations of modern democracies. We discuss the study\
  \ of cultures, the relationships of descent between them, and the challenges in\
  \ building comparative cultural databases. We talk about the role of culture in\
  \ how we respond to climate change. We then get into religion, and discuss its social\
  \ functions; the relationship between moralizing gods and social complexity; and\
  \ how the spread of Christianity occurred. Finally, Dr. Atkinson answers a question\
  \ from a patron.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:55  The cultural foundations\
