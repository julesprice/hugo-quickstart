shownotes: "<p>Dr. David Buss is a Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas\
  \ at Austin. He\u2019s one of the founders of the field of evolutionary psychology.\
  \ His primary research focus is on strategies of human mating. He\u2019s the author\
  \ of many books, including The Evolution of Desire, and the first textbook in Evolutionary\
  \ Psychology, Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind. His most recent\
  \ book is When Men Behave Badly: The Hidden Roots of Sexual Deception, Harassment,\
  \ and Assault.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on When Men Behave Badly. We first\
  \ discuss what sexual conflict is, from an evolutionary perspective, and the evolutionary\
  \ roots of behaviors like sexual deception, harassment and assault. We refer to\
  \ sociocultural perspectives about sexual conflict, and how they complement evolutionary\
  \ psychology. Throughout the interview, we touch on rape, mate guarding behavior,\
  \ and mate value discrepancies and their effects. We also talk about evolutionary\
  \ mismatches in sexual conflict. We touch on possible evolutionary explanations\
  \ for the #metoo movement and the incel movement. Finally, we discuss possible strategies\
  \ to prevent sexual violence, and also ask if people can use evolutionary psychology\
  \ to improve their relationship satisfaction.</p>\n"
