shownotes: "<p>Dr. Ralph Hertwig is Director of the Center for Adaptive Rationality\
  \ at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, Germany. His research\
  \ interests include models of bounded and ecological rationality; decisions from\
  \ experience; the psychology of risk; lifespan development of decision making; and\
  \ evidence-based public policy. He is the editor of Deliberate Ignorance: Choosing\
  \ Not to Know.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Deliberate Ignorance. We define\
  \ bounded rationality, ecological rationality, and deliberate ignorance. We talk\
  \ about the cognitive bases of deliberate rationality, and its relationship with\
  \ biases and heuristics. We discuss how deliberate ignorance can occur in institutions.\
  \ We talk about a possible evolutionary rationale for deliberate ignorance, what\
  \ we know about its development in children, and also the cross-cultural evidence\
  \ for it. We also discuss individual differences in deliberate ignorance, and the\
  \ correlation with scores on the Big Five\u2019s openness to experience. We discuss\
  \ how deliberate ignorance manifests itself in science. Finally, we talk about when\
  \ and why we should fight against deliberate ignorance.</p>\n"
