shownotes: "<p>Dr. Frank Keil is Charles C. &amp; Dorathea S. Dilley Professor of\
  \ Psychology &amp; Linguistics and Director of the Cognition and Development lab\
  \ at Yale University. At the most general level, he is interested in how we come\
  \ to make sense of the world around us. One set of his studies is examining a level\
  \ of explanatory insight that functions without knowledge of specific mechanisms\
  \ and instead involves knowing what sorts of properties are causally potent in a\
  \ domain and how they are likely to interact. He also asks how emerging knowledge\
  \ of concrete mechanisms can link up frequency-based information with abstract explanatory\
  \ principles as well as cause distortions in judgment. He is the author of Developmental\
  \ Psychology: The Growth of Mind and Behavior, and other books.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about topics in developmental psychology. We talk about\
  \ how causal thinking develops, and its relationship with mechanistic thinking.\
  \ We discuss explanation, and the development of explanation schema. We discuss\
  \ if we are Bayesian reasoners. We discuss if scient is intuitive, the concept of\
  \ \u201Cfolk science\u201D, the cultural division of labor, and if the thinking\
  \ of scientists is much different from that of laypeople. Finally, we talk about\
  \ how developmental research can inform the study of cognition in adults, and how\
  \ developmental psychology applies across the lifespan.</p>\n"
