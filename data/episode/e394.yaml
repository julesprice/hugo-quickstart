  \ Research Assistant in the Department of Physics at Oxford University. Her research\
  \ interests include Quantum Theory of Computation, Foundations of Physics, Condensed-Matter\
  \ Physics and Quantum Biology. She is the recipient of numerous awards including\
  \ the \"Graduate Prize Scholarship\" at Merton College, 2012; \"Optime\" Award for\
  \ Academic Excellence, offered by Unione Industriale di Torino, 2011; and the \"\
  Ing. Vittorino Pollo e Dott.Ssa Zita Pollo\" Award for Academic Excellence, offered\
  \ by Fondazione Giovanni Agnelli, 2010.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about quantum\
  \ mechanics, information theory, the universal computer, constructor theory, quantum\
  \ biology, causality and free will, and reality.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:35  What is\
