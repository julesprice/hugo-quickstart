shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 26th 2022.  \nDr. Patrick Savage is Associate Professor\
  \ in the Faculty of Environment and Information Studies at Keio SFC, where he directs\
  \ the CompMusic Lab for comparative and computational musicology. He has academic\
  \ degrees in music composition (BA), psychology (MSc) and musicology (PhD), and\
  \ has won national awards singing Japanese folk song. His research on the evolution\
  \ of music and culture has appeared in outlets including Nature, Proceedings of\
  \ the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, The New York Times, and The Economist.\
  \ \n\nIn this episode, we talk about musicology. We start with the evolution of\
  \ music, and how it relates to language and bird song. We discuss the (social) functions\
  \ of music. We get into the cultural evolution of music, and cross-cultural regularities.\
  \ We ask if music is a uniquely human phenomenon, and if we can learn more about\
  \ biological and cultural diversity by studying musical evolution. We talk about\
  \ music copyright laws. Finally, we address the main challenges of cross-cultural\
  \ work in music cognition, and talk about underexplored questions in musicology.\n\
