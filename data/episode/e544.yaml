  <p>In this episode, we talk about personality, friendship, and attractiveness from
  an evolutionary perspective. We start with personality, and ask how we should understand
  it from an evolutionary standpoint, and discuss if there is a personality inventory
  that would make more sense evolutionarily-speaking. We also discuss if personality
  traits are adaptations. We talk about the condition-dependent model of individual
  differences. We then get into friendship, and discuss it as an evolved phenomenon,
  same-sex and opposite-sex friendships, the phenomenon of friends with benefits,
  and the relationships straight women establish with gay men. Finally, we discuss
  several aspects of physical attractiveness, including symmetry, waist-to-hip ratio,
  neotenous facial features, eyes, lumbar curvature, and the effects of wearing high
  heels. We wrap things up with what we get from studying attractiveness through dating
  apps.</p>
