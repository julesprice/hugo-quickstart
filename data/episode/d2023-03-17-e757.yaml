shownotes: '<p>Dr. Quentin Atkinson is a Professor in Psychology at the University
  of Auckland, where he runs the Language, Cognition and Culture Lab, and co-Director
  of the University of Auckland Behavioural Insights Exchange (UoABIX). He uses lab
  and field experiments, computer modelling and evolutionary theory to answer questions
  including the origins of linguistic diversity, the function of religion, and the
  psychology of climate change.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about politics, culture, and religion. We first talk
  about the cultural foundations of modern democracies. We discuss the study of cultures,
  the relationships of descent between them, and the challenges in building comparative
  cultural databases. We talk about the role of culture in how we respond to climate
  change. We then get into religion, and discuss its social functions; the relationship
  between moralizing gods and social complexity; and how the spread of Christianity
  occurred. Finally, Dr. Atkinson answers a question from a patron.</p>
