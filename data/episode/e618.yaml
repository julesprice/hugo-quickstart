  <p>In this episode, we focus on How to Talk to a Science Denier. We characterize
  a science denier, and talk about the five tropes of science denial. We discuss how
  politics and ideology influence science denial. We talk about the strategies people
  can use to engage with science deniers. We discuss the social aspects of science
  denial. We talk about philosophers who deny the epistemology of science. We talk
  about how science tends to be counterintuitive, and what to do when there is not
  enough information. We discuss the different types of science deniers. Finally,
  Dr. McIntyre gives us a guide on how to first approach a science denier.</p>
