shownotes: "<p>Dr. Francesca Righetti is an Associate Professor at the Department\
  \ of Experimental and Applied Psychology at the VU Amsterdam. Dr. Righetti\u2019\
  s research focuses on close relationships. More specifically she studies sacrifice,\
  \ ambivalence, and how dual processes shape relationship dynamics.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we talk about close relationships. We first discuss sacrifice: what motivates\
  \ it, when it is expected, when people regret it, and how they weigh its costs.\
  \ We discuss when empathy is a burden, perceived partner responsiveness, and how\
  \ people deal with conflict. We talk about the role that self-control plays in close\
  \ relationships. We discuss interpersonal goal support, and promoting one another\u2019\
  s ideal selves. We talk about attachment security, anxious and avoidant attachment\
  \ styles, and how security can be fostered. We discuss ambivalence in romantic relationships,\
  \ and implicit partner evaluation. Finally, we talk about the factors that contribute\
  \ to the maintenance and decline of relationship satisfaction.</p>\n"
