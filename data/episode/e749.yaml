shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 9th 2023.  \nDr. Francesca Righetti is an Associate\
  \ Professor at the Department of Experimental and Applied Psychology at the VU Amsterdam.\
  \ Dr. Righetti\u2019s research focuses on close relationships. More specifically\
  \ she studies sacrifice, ambivalence, and how dual processes shape relationship\
  \ dynamics (e.g., implicit partner evaluations, self-control, automatic processes).\
  \ Besides obtaining several grants (e.g., the VENI, ORA, and VIDI grants from NWO),\
  \ she has also won several awards such as the Caryl Rusbult Early Career Award from\
  \ Relationship Researchers Interest Group (RRIG), the Early Career Award from the\
  \ European Association of Social Psychology (EASP) and the Raising Star Award from\
  \ the Association for Psychological Science (APS).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ close relationships. We first discuss sacrifice: what motivates it, when it is\
  \ expected, when people regret it, and how they weigh its costs. We discuss when\
  \ empathy is a burden, perceived partner responsiveness, and how people deal with\
  \ conflict. We talk about the role that self-control plays in close relationships.\
  \ We discuss interpersonal goal support, and promoting one another\u2019s ideal\
  \ selves. We talk about attachment security, anxious and avoidant attachment styles,\
  \ and how security can be fostered. We discuss ambivalence in romantic relationships,\
  \ and implicit partner evaluation. Finally, we talk about the factors that contribute\
  \ to the maintenance and decline of relationship satisfaction.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
