shownotes: "Dr. Kevin Mitchell is Associate Professor of Genetics and Neuroscience\
  \ at Trinity College Dublin. He is interested in the development of connectivity\
  \ in the brain, specifically in how this process is controlled by genes and how\
  \ mutations in such genes affect the connectivity of neuronal circuits, influence\
  \ behavior and perception and contribute to disease. His latest book is Free Agents:\
  \ How Evolution Gave Us Free Will.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Free Agents.\
  \ We start by discussing how scientists approach free will, and if we should define\
  \ free will. We go through some of the major steps in the evolution of free will,\
  \ and talk about the origins of life on Earth; informational causation; the purpose\
  \ of life; meaning and value; the evolution of decision making; agency; the evolution\
  \ of nervous systems; the neocortex; and self-awareness. We talk about how we simulate\
  \ different courses of action, and how we should understand decision making as a\
  \ process. We discuss indeterminacy in Physics and Neuroscience. We talk about the\
  \ Libet experiments, and studies of brain legions. We discuss personality traits\
  \ and other psychological predispositions. We talk about constraints and top-down\
  \ causation. Finally, we discuss the link between free will and moral responsibility.\n\
