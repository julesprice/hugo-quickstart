  \ of Philosophy at Duke University, and Laureate Professor of Philosophy at the\
  \ University of Arizona. He has written six books covering such topics as applied\
  \ ethics (especially bio-medical ethics), social justice, and international justice,\
  \ including the foundations of international law. He is the author of Our Moral\
  \ Fate: Evolution and the Escape from Tribalism.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus\
  \ on Our Moral Fate. &nbsp;We discuss how to think about morality from an evolutionary\
  \ perspective. We get into wrong assumptions people have about tribalism and cooperation.\
  \ We talk about the Two Great Expansions of our moral circle, involving human beings\
  \ and nonhuman animals. We discuss how moral progress occurs, and if we should talk\
  \ about moral change in terms of \u201Cprogress\u201D and \u201Cregress\u201D. We\
  \ talk about moral reasoning and its limitations. We get into what ideology is from\
  \ an evolutionary perspective. Finally, we talk about recent tribalism, and scientifically-informed\
  \ moral institutional design.</p>\n"
