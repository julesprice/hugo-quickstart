shownotes: '<p>Dr. Bianca Acevedo is an Instructor at New York University. She is
  a social neuroscientist whose research focuses on the neural basis of attachment,
  caregiving, sensory processing sensitivity (and related disorders), and mind-body
  interventions. She conducted the first neuroimaging studies of long-term pair-bonding
  in humans for which she was awarded the 2012 International Women in Science Award.
  She joined the NRI in 2016 where she has been examining empathy in caregivers of
  ADRD individuals. Dr. Acevedo is interested in understanding the biological basis
  of human attachment and sensory processing sensitivity. In addition, her research
  examines the neural and behavioral outcomes associated with engaging in mind-body
  practices in clinical and normative individuals and dyads.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about attachment from a neuroscientific perspective.
  We get into romantic love, and relationship satisfaction. We discuss sensory processing
  sensitivity, and its relationship with mental disorders like depression. Finally,
  we talk about social neuroscience, and how social psychology intersects with neuroscience.</p>
