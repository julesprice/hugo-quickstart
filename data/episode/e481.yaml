shownotes: "<p>Dr. Saul Smilansky is a Professor at the Department of Philosophy of\
  \ the University of Haifa, Israel. He works primarily on normative and applied ethics,\
  \ the free will problem, and the meaning of life. He is the author of Free Will\
  \ and Illusion (Oxford University Press 2000), and 10 Moral Paradoxes (Blackwell\
  \ 2007).</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on moral paradoxes. We first define them,\
  \ and then we go through some of them, including misfortunes, the paradox of beneficial\
  \ retirement, punishment, feeling sorry when bad things happen, moral complaint,\
  \ the obligation to have children and antinatalism, and moral worth. Toward the\
  \ end, we talk about a normative moral theory that Dr. Smilansky developed, which\
  \ he calls \u201CDesigner Ethics\u201D.</p>\n"
