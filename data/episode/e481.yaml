shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 5th 2021.  \nDr. Saul Smilansky is a Professor at the\
  \ Department of Philosophy of the University of Haifa, Israel. He works primarily\
  \ on normative and applied ethics, the free will problem, and the meaning of life.\
  \ He is the author of Free Will and Illusion (Oxford University Press 2000), and\
  \ 10 Moral Paradoxes (Blackwell 2007).\n\nIn this episode, we focus on moral paradoxes.\
  \ We first define them, and then we go through some of them, including misfortunes,\
  \ the paradox of beneficial retirement, punishment, feeling sorry when bad things\
  \ happen, moral complaint, the obligation to have children and antinatalism, and\
  \ moral worth. Toward the end, we talk about a normative moral theory that Dr. Smilansky\
  \ developed, which he calls \u201CDesigner Ethics\u201D. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
