shownotes: "<p>Dr. Frans de Waal is a Dutch primatologist and ethologist. He is Emeritus\
  \ Candler Professor at Emory University, and Emeritus Professor at the University\
  \ of Utrecht, and author of numerous books including Chimpanzee Politics, The Bonobo\
  \ and the Atheist, Mamma\u2019s Last Hug, and, more recently, Different: Gender\
  \ Through the Eyes of a Primatologist.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Different.\
  \ We first ask where behavioral sex differences come from, and how we compare to\
  \ other great Apes. We discuss self-socialization. We talk about prejudices regarding\
  \ gender. We tackle assumptions about ancestral human violence, alpha males (and\
  \ alpha females), females having multiple partners, the male sex drive, the female\
  \ orgasm, and forced copulation. We talk about aspects of human social organization,\
  \ like male bonding, female bonding, and nuclear families. We discuss human paternal\
  \ investment. We talk about potential issues with ignoring and exacerbating behavioral\
  \ sex differences. Finally, Dr. de Waal gives us a summary of how to think about\
  \ behavioral sex differences.</p>\n"
