shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 18th 2022.  \nDr. Frans de Waal is a Dutch primatologist\
  \ and ethologist. He is Emeritus Candler Professor at Emory University, and Emeritus\
  \ Professor at the University of Utrecht, and author of numerous books including\
  \ Chimpanzee Politics, The Bonobo and the Atheist, Mamma\u2019s Last Hug, and, more\
  \ recently, Different: Gender Through the Eyes of a Primatologist.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on Different. We first ask where behavioral sex differences come from,\
  \ and how we compare to other great Apes. We discuss self-socialization. We talk\
  \ about prejudices regarding gender. We tackle assumptions about ancestral human\
  \ violence, alpha males (and alpha females), females having multiple partners, the\
  \ male sex drive, the female orgasm, and forced copulation. We talk about aspects\
  \ of human social organization, like male bonding, female bonding, and nuclear families.\
  \ We discuss human paternal investment. We talk about potential issues with ignoring\
  \ and exacerbating behavioral sex differences. Finally, Dr. de Waal gives us a summary\
  \ of how to think about behavioral sex differences.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
