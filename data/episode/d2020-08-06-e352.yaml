shownotes: "<p>Dr. Marco Del Giudice is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology\
  \ at the University of New Mexico. In his work he explores a wide range of topics\
  \ at the intersection of human behavior, evolution, and development. His approach\
  \ is interdisciplinary and driven by the quest for theoretical synthesis. Over the\
  \ years he has developed some broad, integrative models: the Adaptive Calibration\
  \ Model of individual differences in stress responsivity (with Bruce Ellis and Birdie\
  \ Shirtcliff); an evolutionary-developmental model of sex differences in attachment\
  \ styles; and a unifying life history framework for evolutionary psychopathology.\
  \ Most of his current empirical work is devoted to testing, advancing, and refining\
  \ these models with a variety of research methods. He\u2019s the author of Evolutionary\
  \ Psychopathology: A Unified Approach.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on psychological\
  \ gender differences. We talk about play in males and females; differences in education\
  \ and occupational choices, according to personality tendencies; assessing sex differences\
  \ and similarities; gender stereotypes, and if they are right; the distinction between\
  \ \u201Csex\u201D and \u201Cgender\u201D, and if it is a useful one; evolutionary\
  \ and socialization theories of sex differences; things that people from the socialization\
  \ side get wrong about evolutionary psychology; animal models, and comparative psychology;\
  \ and, finally, why it is important, not only for scientists but also to the general\
  \ public, to study and learn about sex differences.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n"
