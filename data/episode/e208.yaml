shownotes: "Dr. David Wootton is Anniversary Professor of History at the University\
  \ of York. He works on the intellectual and cultural history of the English-speaking\
  \ countries, Italy, and France, from the 17th to the 19th centuries. His most recent\
  \ book is Power, Pleasure, and Profit published by Harvard University Press, and\
  \ he\u2019s also the author of The Invention of Science: A New History of the Scientific\
  \ Revolution. He has given the Carlyle and Besterman Lectures at Oxford, the Raleigh\
  \ Lecture at the British Academy and the Benedict Lectures at Boston.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about some of the main topics explored by Dr. Wootton in The\
  \ Invention of Science. We discuss the historical precursors of science, and the\
  \ new conceptual framework that developed around the 17th century. We also refer\
  \ to the progress of science, where Thomas Kuhn failed, the relationship between\
  \ philosophy and science, and science as a cultural construct. We go through the\
  \ earliest developments in Astronomy and Earth geography, the discovery of the Americas\
  \ and the historical relationship between science and political power. We discuss\
  \ some hypotheses for why China did not get to develop science before Europe, and\
  \ the relationship between science and technology. Finally, we look into how science\
  \ might have influenced the development of capitalism (and vice-versa).\n\nTime\
