shownotes: "<p>Dr. Colin Holbrook is Assistant Professor of Cognitive and Information\
  \ Sciences at the University of California Merced. He researches decision-making\
  \ under contexts of threat, with particular focus on political orientation, group\
  \ prejudice, and the representation of mental states.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we\
  \ focus on the psychology of threat, threat detection, threat salience, and response\
  \ to threat. We first ask what threat is really about, and the kinds of threat that\
  \ exist, as well as how people respond to it. We also talk about how threat might\
  \ change group dynamics of competition and cooperation, and the effects that religiousness\
  \ has on the psychological impact of threat. Finally, we mention some of the topics\
  \ that Dr. Holbrook is exploring in the domain of human-robot interaction, something\
  \ that, if all goes well, we will be digging deeper later this year.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
