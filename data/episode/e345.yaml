shownotes: "RECORDED ON April 29th 2020.  \nDr. Colin Holbrook is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Cognitive and Information Sciences at the University of California Merced.\
  \ He researches decision-making under contexts of threat, with particular focus\
  \ on political orientation, group prejudice, and the representation of mental states.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on the psychology of threat, threat detection, threat\
  \ salience, and response to threat. We first ask what threat is really about, and\
  \ the kinds of threat that exist, as well as how people respond to it. We also talk\
  \ about how threat might change group dynamics of competition and cooperation, and\
  \ the effects that religiousness has on the psychological impact of threat. Finally,\
  \ we mention some of the topics that Dr. Holbrook is exploring in the domain of\
  \ human-robot interaction, something that, if all goes well, we will be digging\
  \ deeper later this year.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:41  What is threat?  \n07:11  The\
