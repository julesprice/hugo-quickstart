shownotes: "<p>Dr. Derek Elliott is a newly minted doctor of philosophy from Duquesne\
  \ University. He specializes in philosophy of psychology as well as action theory\
  \ with a special interest in irrationality and evolutionary psychology.</p>\n<p>In\
  \ this episode, we go through some of the main topics of Dr. Elliott\u2019s dissertation,\
  \ \u201CBeyond Enlightenment: The Evolution of Agency and the Modularity of the\
  \ Mind in a Post-Darwinian World\u201D. We talk about some of the values and beliefs\
  \ of the Enlightenment that recent science, particularly the evolutionary behavioral\
  \ sciences, has been undermining, namely reason, free will, and the notion of agency.\
  \ We talk about the argumentative theory of reason. We also discuss how most of\
  \ what happens in our minds occurs at a subconscious level, and how we have very\
  \ little control over our behavior, and how very little we understand about our\
  \ motivations and the causes of our actions. We also talk a little but about consciousness,\
  \ the relationship between consciousness, free will and agency, self-deception,\
  \ the modular approach to the human mind, and the meaning of life from a Darwinian\
  \ perspective.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:51 What the Enlightenment got wrong</p>\n\
