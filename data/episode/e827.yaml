shownotes: "Podcast: http://bit.ly/3FeSNqb\n\nDr. Joseph Henrich is Professor and\
  \ chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. He\
  \ is interested in the question of how humans evolved from \"being a relatively\
  \ unremarkable primate a few million years ago to the most successful species on\
  \ the globe\", and how culture affected our genetic development. He is also the\
  \ author of The Secret of Our Success, and The WEIRDest People in the World: How\
  \ the West Became Psychologically Peculiar and Particularly Prosperous.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we start by talking about how culture shapes human psychology; human\
  \ universals, and cognitive phenotypes; how different fields reacted to the WEIRD\
  \ problem; and the replication crisis. We discuss how to understand biases, like\
  \ the prestige bias. We talk about what drives innovation, and cumulative culture.\
  \ We discuss the collective brain hypothesis, and reframing how we think about intelligence\
  \ and IQ. We talk about assortative mating, human mating systems, and the relationship\
  \ between polygyny and inequality. We discuss religion, Big Gods, and theory of\
  \ mind. We talk about the best methods to study psychology historically. Finally,\
  \ we discuss if we rely too much on English speakers in the study of human cognition,\
  \ and the need for people from more diverse cultural backgrounds in science.\n\n\
