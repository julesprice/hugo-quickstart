shownotes: "<p>Dr. Joseph Henrich is Professor and chair of the Department of Human\
  \ Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. He is interested in the question of\
  \ how humans evolved from &quot;being a relatively unremarkable primate a few million\
  \ years ago to the most successful species on the globe&quot;, and how culture affected\
  \ our genetic development. He is also the author of The Secret of Our Success, and\
  \ The WEIRDest People in the World: How the West Became Psychologically Peculiar\
  \ and Particularly Prosperous.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we start by talking\
  \ about how culture shapes human psychology; human universals, and cognitive phenotypes;\
  \ how different fields reacted to the WEIRD problem; and the replication crisis.\
  \ We discuss how to understand biases, like the prestige bias. We talk about what\
  \ drives innovation, and cumulative culture. We discuss the collective brain hypothesis,\
  \ and reframing how we think about intelligence and IQ. We talk about assortative\
  \ mating, human mating systems, and the relationship between polygyny and inequality.\
  \ We discuss religion, Big Gods, and theory of mind. We talk about the best methods\
  \ to study psychology historically. Finally, we discuss if we rely too much on English\
  \ speakers in the study of human cognition, and the\nneed for people from more diverse\
  \ cultural backgrounds in science.</p>\n"
