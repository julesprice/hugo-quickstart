shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 3rd 2021.  \nDr. John Barry is a Chartered Psychologist\
  \ and Associate Fellow of the British Psychological Society (BPS), Honorary Lecturer\
  \ in Psychology at University College London, clinical hypnotherapist and author\
  \ of around 70 peer-reviewed publications on a variety of topics in psychology and\
  \ health, including many on male psychology. He has also co-authored letters to\
  \ The Psychologist magazine to raise awareness of issues relevant to male psychology.\
  \ He is also co-author (with Louise Liddon) of the new book Perspectives in Male\
  \ Psychology: An Introduction. \n\nThis is the first of a two-part talk where we\
  \ focus on Perspectives in Male Psychology. In this episode, we talk about male\
  \ psychology and mental health. We start by talking about the clinical goals of\
  \ studying male psychology and sex differences, and the biases that usually contaminate\
  \ research in this area. We discuss some issues with guidelines for practice with\
  \ boys and men. We talk about how we go about integrating different perspectives\
  \ on male psychology (evolutionary, biological, social, humanistic). We ask to what\
  \ extent being masculine is important for male well-being. We get into some of the\
  \ issues that affect men more than women, like substance abuse, suicide, homelessness,\
  \ and singlehood, and how father absence affects development. We discuss how clinical\
  \ practice tends to be feminized, and how it could suit men more. Finally, we talk\
  \ about alpha, beta, and gamma biases in research on male psychology, and problems\
  \ with clinical research not informed by sex differences.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
