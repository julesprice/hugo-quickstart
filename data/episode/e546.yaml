  <p>This is the first of a two-part talk where we focus on Perspectives in Male Psychology.
  In this episode, we talk about male psychology and mental health. We start by talking
  about the clinical goals of studying male psychology and sex differences, and the
  biases that usually contaminate research in this area. We discuss some issues with
  guidelines for practice with boys and men. We talk about how we go about integrating
  different perspectives on male psychology (evolutionary, biological, social, humanistic).
  We ask to what extent being masculine is important for male well-being. We get into
  some of the issues that affect men more than women, like substance abuse, suicide,
  homelessness, and singlehood, and how father absence affects development. We discuss
  how clinical practice tends to be feminized, and how it could suit men more. Finally,
  we talk about alpha, beta, and gamma biases in research on male psychology, and
  problems with clinical research not informed by sex differences.</p>
