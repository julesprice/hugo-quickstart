  \ and even the social and moral aspects of it. We also talk about certain specific\
  \ issues, like depression, mental suffering, suicide and euthanasia; human enhancement\
  \ in psychiatry, the difference between enhancement and therapy, and the ethics\
  \ behind it; and also when and how people should resort to psychiatry and neuroscience\
  \ in the penal system, and issue regarding free will and moral responsibility. Toward\
  \ the end, Dr. Roache also tells us about her upcoming book on swearing.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n\
