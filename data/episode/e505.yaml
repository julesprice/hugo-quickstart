  <p>In this episode, we talk about philosophy of mind, with a focus on The Given.
  We go through several different concepts, like mental content, intentionality, and
  phenomenology. We discuss cognition, perception and sensory experience, and the
  relationship between them. We talk about the nature of consciousness. And we discuss
  the relationship between mind and metaphysics, the metaphysics of mental phenomena,
  the access we have to reality, and the metaphysical nature of reality.</p>
