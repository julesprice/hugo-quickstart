shownotes: "<p>Dr. Peggy Mason is a Professor in the Department of Neurobiology at\
  \ the University of Chicago. She received both her BA in Biology and her Phd in\
  \ Neuroscience from Harvard. Professor Mason has been on the faculty of University\
  \ of Chicago since 1992. She has taught undergraduate, graduate and medical students\
  \ and has received numerous teaching awards. Using her nearly 15 years of experience\
  \ teaching medical students, Professor Mason wrote a single-author textbook designed\
  \ for medical students (Medical Neurobiology, Oxford University Press, 2017). Professor\
  \ Mason's research focuses on the neurobiological basis of empathy and helping.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about empathy and helping behavior in humans and other\
  \ animal models, namely rats. We discuss first how empathy might have evolved, and\
  \ the neurobiological bases of it, including the roles played by the amygdala, the\
  \ hypothalamus, the prefrontal cortex and the temporo-parietal junction. We also\
  \ talk about the flaws with the research surrounding mirror neurons. Then, we talk\
  \ about the situations that invoke empathy. We also refer to Paul Bloom\u2019s book,\
  \ Against Empathy, and the difference between emotional empathy and cognitive empathy,\
  \ and between empathy and compassion. We also briefly refer to how empathy might\
  \ work in psychopaths. Finally, we talk about oxytocin and other hormones and neurotransmitters\
  \ that participate in mediating empathic behavior, and the differences between pro-social\
  \ behavior in humans and other animals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n\
