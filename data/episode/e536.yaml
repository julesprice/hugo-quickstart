  Arts and Professor of Psychology. He and his students are exploring natural language
  use, group dynamics, and personality in both laboratory and real-world settings.
  His earlier work on expressive writing found that physical health and work performance

  and computer science. Author or editor of 12 books and over 300 articles, Pennebaker

  <p>In this episode, we talk about what we can learn about human psychology through
  written language. We first discuss the functions of language, and how it influences
  cognition. We get into written language, and the psychological benefits of writing,
  particularly expressive writing. We also talk about predicting relationship breakdowns
  through language use, personality traits, stories, and sex differences in language
  use.</p>
