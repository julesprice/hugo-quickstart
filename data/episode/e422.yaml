shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 11th 2020.  \nDr. Michael Tomasello is an American\
  \ developmental and comparative psychologist, as well as linguist. He is Emeritus\
  \ Director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig,\
  \ and professor of psychology at Duke University. Earning many prizes and awards\
  \ from the end of the 1990s onward, he is considered one of today's most authoritative\
  \ developmental and comparative psychologists. He is \"one of the few scientists\
  \ worldwide who is acknowledged as an expert in multiple disciplines\". His \"pioneering\
  \ research on the origins of social cognition has led to revolutionary insights\
  \ in both developmental psychology and primate cognition.\" He\u2019s also the author\
  \ of several books, including The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition (1999), A\
  \ Natural History of Human Thinking (2014), A Natural History of Human Morality\
  \ (2016), and Becoming Human: A Theory of Ontogeny (2019).\n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ talk about developmental and comparative psychology, with a focus on Dr. Tomasello\u2019\
  s latest book, Becoming Human. Topics include: comparative psychology, and how to\
  \ compare ourselves to other primates; three types of morality (derived from kin\
  \ selection; derived from interdependence; derived from culture); shared and collective\
  \ intentionality; the development of institutions; the relationship between sociality\
  \ and morality; natural and cultural morality; group selection; if human morality\
  \ is innate; the importance of language; and studying isolated children.\n\nTime\
