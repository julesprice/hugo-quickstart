shownotes: "<p>Dr. Kristen Lindquist is a Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience\
  \ at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Her research seeks to understand\
  \ the psychological and neural basis of emotions, moods, and feelings. Her ongoing\
  \ work uses tools from social cognition, physiology, neuroscience, and big data\
  \ methods to examine how emotions emerge from the confluence of the body, brain,\
  \ and culture.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we start by talking about a multidisciplinary\
  \ approach to emotions. We discuss if infants really perceive and understand facial\
  \ configurations as instances of discrete emotion categories, and why there is so\
  \ much focus on the face. We talk about the cross-cultural study of emotions. We\
  \ discuss how children acquire emotion concepts. We talk about emotional aging,\
  \ and an embodied cognitive approach to emotion. We discuss gender variation in\
  \ the experience of emotion. We talk about moral foundations theory, and an alternative\
  \ constructionist perspective on the link between morality and emotion. We discuss\
  \ if some people are more emotionally complex than others. We discuss if people\
  \ universally essentialize emotions, and research on basic emotions. We talk about\
  \ a network approach to the brain. Finally, we discuss gender gaps in representation\
  \ and career advancement in the sciences, and what explains them.</p>\n"
