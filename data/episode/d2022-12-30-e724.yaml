shownotes: '<p>Dr. Lucia Melloni is a Research Leader of the Neural Circuits, Consciousness
  and Cognition Group at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics. Her research
  areas include domain-general cortical computations, neural mechanisms by which the
  brain predictively controls sensory processing and perception, brain mechanism subserving
  language comprehension, and possibilities and limits of brain plasticity to restore
  cognitive functions.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about consciousness, language, and neuroplasticity.
  We start with consciousness, how it is studied in neuroscience, the neural correlates
  of consciousness, the hard problem of consciousness, and its causal power over behavior.
  We discuss conscious perception, and how language connects to consciousness. Finally,
  we talk about the limits of neuroplasticity.</p>
