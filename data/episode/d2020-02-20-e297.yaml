shownotes: "<p>Dr. Richard Ronay is Associate Professor of Leadership and Management\
  \ at University of Amsterdam Business School. His research interests include power\
  \ and status; social hierarchy; leadership; inequality; overconfidence; social intelligence;\
  \ decision making; evolutionary psychology; and social neuroendocrinology.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we focus on human social hierarchies and leadership. We first\
  \ talk about social hierarchy from an evolutionary perspective, the different kinds\
  \ of hierarchies that we can establish, and sex differences in competition. Then\
  \ we discuss leadership, the traits that tend to go along with it, and the role\
  \ that traits like overconfidence and risk-taking might play. We also refer to the\
  \ relationship between hierarchy and group effectiveness, and the relationship between\
  \ reversal learning (the ability to detect changing contingencies) and social success.\
  \ Finally, we talk about risk-taking as a sexual display strategy.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
