shownotes: '<p>Dr. Gillian Forrester is a Professor of Comparative Cognition in the
  School of Psychology at the University of Sussex. She is the director of the Comparative
  Cognition Group investigating the behaviors and brain organization of children,
  gorillas and chimpanzees focusing on how cognitive abilities evolve and develop
  over time and across species.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about the evolution of handedness and how it relates
  to language and other cognitive abilities. We first define handedness, and talk
  about how it evolved. We discuss if human hands are more dexterous, and how handedness
  works in Great apes. We discuss if it is innate, and which environmental factors
  play a role in its development. We then get into the neuroscience of handedness
  and how it relates to cerebral lateralization. We talk about how cerebral lateralization
  might connect to (higher) cognitive functions, and we discuss if there is a relationship
  between handedness and cognitive ability. We also discuss the relationship between
  handedness (and motor function more generally) and language, and the biological
  precursors of language. Finally, Dr. Forrester answers a question from a patron.</p>
