shownotes: "<p>Dr. Eric Funkhouser is Professor and Departmental Chair of Philosophy\
  \ at the University of Arkansas. His main areas of research are in the philosophy\
  \ of psychology/mind and metaphysics. He is currently working on a series of papers\
  \ concerning how social forces shape the functions of belief and other mental states.\
  \ This work should culminate in a book, The Signaling Mind: Belief as Social Manipulation.\
  \ In this manuscript, he argues that many beliefs serve a signaling function\u2014\
  much like animal signals used to manipulate other animals\u2014that explains various\
  \ irrational and dangerous beliefs, cognitive biases, as well as pro-social beliefs.</p>\n\
  <p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about beliefs, and self-deception. We first\
  \ discuss what beliefs are, if they are always conscious, and how we study them.\
  \ We talk about how to interpret incongruencies between belief and behavior. We\
  \ discuss the signaling functions of beliefs, and how they apply to irrational beliefs,\
  \ cognitive biases, and dangerous beliefs. We then get into self-deception, and\
  \ discuss the different philosophical and scientific approaches to it. We also talk\
  \ about the functions of self-deception, and discuss if it really works.</p>\n"
