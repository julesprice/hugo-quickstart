shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 10th 2022.  \nDr. Charles Fernyhough is a Professor\
  \ of Psychology at Durham University, where he is also Director of the Centre for\
  \ Research into Inner Experience. He has contributed to the understanding of how\
  \ language and thought are related in child development and beyond. The focus of\
  \ his recent scientific work has been in applying ideas from mainstream developmental\
  \ psychology to the study of psychosis, particularly the phenomenon of voice-hearing.\
  \ He is the author of books like Pieces of Light: The New Science of Memory, and\
  \ The Voices Within: The History and Science of How We Talk to Ourselves.\n\nIn\
  \ this episode, we talk about inner speech, imaginary companions, and hallucinations.\
  \ We start with inner speech, how it develops in children, its connection to language,\
  \ its functions, its neuroscience, and rumination. We then talk about imaginary\
  \ companions, why children have them, how they influence how they think about their\
  \ real-life friends, and their link to inner speech. We also discuss auditory verbal\
  \ hallucinations, their neuroscience (with a focus on resting state networks and\
  \ the default mode network); how people sometimes personalize the voices they hear;\
  \ musical hallucinations; and multimodal hallucinations. Finally, we discuss how\
  \ to think about distinguishing clinical from non-clinical conditions.\n\nTime Links:\
