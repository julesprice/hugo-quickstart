shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 4th 2022.  \nDr. Masahiro Morioka is a professor of\
  \ philosophy and ethics at Waseda University, Japan. He is considered by many to\
  \ be one of the most influential thinkers in the current Japanese philosophical\
  \ community, along with Hitoshi Nagai (Nihon University), and Motoyoshi Irifuji\
  \  (Aoyama Gakuin University). He is the director of Tokyo Philosophy Project, and\
  \ the editor-in-chief of Journal of Philosophy of Life. He specializes in philosophy\
  \ of life, life studies, bioethics, gender studies, and criticism of contemporary\
  \ civilization. He is the author of books like Nihilism and the Meaning of Life:\
  \ A Philosophical Dialogue with James Tartaglia, and Manga Introduction to Philosophy:\
  \ An Exploration of Time, Existence, the Self, and the Meaning of Life.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on Manga Introduction to Philosophy. We start by asking what\
  \ is philosophy, and how it can relate to the life of ordinary people. We talk about\
  \ the philosophy of life and what Dr. Morioka calls \u201Clife studies\u201D. We\
  \ go through concepts and ideas explored in the book, like \u201Cnow\u201D, \u201C\
  past-present-future\u201D, the fear of death, life as suffering, what it is to \u201C\
  exist\u201D, solipsism, and birth. We discuss antinatalism. We talk about issues\
  \ in modern industrialized societies, and current trends in Japanese culture and\
  \ society. Finally, we talk about manga as a cultural phenomenon in Japan and as\
  \ a medium to explore philosophical ideas.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n01:05\
