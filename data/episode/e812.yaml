shownotes: "<p>M\xE9lusine Boon-Falleur is a PhD student in cognitive sciences at\
  \ the <a href=\"\">\xC9cole Normale Sup\xE9rieure (ENS) Paris</a>, researching how\
  \ evolution shaped our brain. She is\nparticularly interested in studying how individuals\
  \ adapt to the amount of resources available in their environment, and how our social\
  \ cognition influences pro-environmental behavior.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we focus on how resources impact psychology, and climate change. We start by talking\
  \ about noncognitive skills and their impact on academic achievement. We then get\
  \ into how quantitative changes in resources lead to qualitative changes in people\u2019\
  s priorities and psychology. We discuss the importance of time horizons, and talk\
  \ about pyramids of needs. We discuss how resource allocation affects cooperation\
  \ and health-related behavior. We discuss risky behaviors through different time\
  \ horizons, and approaches to prevent hazardous behaviors. We talk about where stereotypes\
  \ about the behavior of people of low socioeconomic status come from. We discuss\
  \ how people formed perceived morbidity and mortality risks associated with COVID-19.\
  \ We talk about the belief-action gap and what explains it. We discuss the labeling\
  \ of behaviors as \u201Cirrational\u201D. Finally, we talk about the social dilemma\
  \ of climate change and the cognitive mechanisms that play a role in environmental\
  \ policies, and the important role of social scientists in helping tackle climate\
  \ change.</p>\n"
