  <p>In this episode, we talk about fiction, and worldbuilding. We first focus on\
  \ how to create compelling characters, and we refer to the Game of Thrones series\
  \ finale as a bad example of it. We also explore the psychology of failed expectations.\
  \ We then get into how people want meaning from fiction, and how tragedies like\
  \ war might provide that. We also discuss popular genres and why they are so successful,\
  \ and how politics and morality might ruin good literature. We finish by talking\
  \ about how fiction can work as a thought-experiment, and how it is not so detached\
  \ from things humans develop through culture.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Victoria\u2019\
