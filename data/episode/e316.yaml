shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 18th, 2020.  \nDr. Colin Wright is Eberly Fellow in\
  \ the Department of Biology at Pennsylvania State University. His research explores\
  \ the effects of animal personality on collective behavior and colony success. \
  \ Using a combination of laboratory and field experiments, he tests for relationships\
  \ between group personality composition, inter-colony differences in collective\
  \ behavior and behavioral flexibility, and colony performance. He uses social spiders\
  \ (genus Stegodyphus) and paper wasps (genus Polistes) to probe these topics.\n\n\
  In this episode, we focus on insect personality. We start by discussing how we can\
  \ properly study animal personality, and what it is about. We also talk about insect\
  \ personality at the individual and collective levels, we ask if it can be facultative,\
  \ and we refer to behavioral plasticity. We also mention the impact of human intervention\
  \ in these species\u2019 habitats, group and multilevel selection, and how keystone\
  \ individuals influence collective learning and group success. We explore if it\
  \ is possible to gain some insights about animal personality that could be extrapolated\
  \ from these insect societies to other social animals. Finally, we go through some\
  \ of the main topics of a Quillette article by Dr. Wright, \u201CThe New Evolution\
  \ Deniers\u201D, and refer to issues regarding primarily sex and gender.\n\nTime\
