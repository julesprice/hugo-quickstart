shownotes: '<p>Dr. Erik Kimbrough is an associate professor of economics at the Smith
  Institute for Political Economy and Philosophy in the Argyros School of Business
  and Economics at Chapman University. His research uses experiments to explore the
  underpinnings of prosociality, cooperation and conflict resolution and to identify
  the origins of economic institutions such as property rights. He has also worked
  on finding ways to increase the supply of transplantable organs, measuring the spitefulness
  of individuals, understanding the sources of asset price bubbles, evaluating individual
  theory of mind, and capturing the discovery process underlying specialization and
  trade, among other topics.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about behavioral economics. We start with norms, their
  origins, and why do people follow them. We also talk about institutions, personal
  and impersonal exchange, specialization, and theory of mind. Toward the end, we
  talk about organ donations, and adolescent smoking.</p>
