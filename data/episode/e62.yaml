shownotes: "Dr. Lewis Goldberg is an American personality psychologist and a Professor\
  \ Emeritus at the University of Oregon. He is closely associated with the lexical\
  \ hypothesis, that says that any culturally important personality characteristic\
  \ will be represented in the language of the particular culture. This hypothesis\
  \ led to the discovery of a five-factor structure of personality trait adjectives\
  \ (which he dubbed the Big Five).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about: the scientific\
  \ history behind the lexical hypothesis; what happened in the 70\u2019s that led\
  \ to the development of the Big Five personality inventory; the limitations of the\
  \ Big Five, and comparison with other personality inventories, like the HEXACO and\
  \ the Myers-Briggs; personality traits in other animals; the distinction between\
  \ temperament and personality; the ten aspects of the Big Five; the possibility\
  \ of applying the Big Five to clinical psychology; and the International Personality\
  \ Item Pool (IPIP). \n\nTime Links:  \n01:00  The lexical hypothesis, or studying\
