  Organization from Lizards to Humans.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on The Evolution of Agency. We talk about agency from
  an evolutionary perspective, focusing on the feedback control model of agency, and
  go through evolutionary history, touching on the first animate actors, the first
  goal-directed agents, the first intentional agents, the first rational agents, and
  the first socially normative agents. We talk about some representatives of each
  of them. We discuss where goals come from, the role of emotions, the understanding
  of agency in animals, social norms, and the role of culture in collective agency.
  We also discuss the aspects of sociality that are uniquely human. Finally, we talk
  about free will.</p>
