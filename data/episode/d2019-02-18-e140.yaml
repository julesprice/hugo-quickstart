  \ of the field. His current work applies neuroscience to build high performance\
  \ organizations and to understand and guide consumer decisions. Dr. Zak is the founding\
  \ Director of the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies and Professor of Economics,\
  \ Psychology and Management at Claremont Graduate University. He has degrees in\

  \ of Love and Prosperity, and Trust Factor: The Science of Creating High-Performance\
  \ Companies.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about neuroeconomics, and the role\
  \ that oxytocin plays in attachment, and in promoting trust among people that are\
  \ part of the same organization or society. We go through how oxytocin evolved,\
  \ and the kinds of prosocial behavior that it mediates. We also refer to other hormones,\
  \ like testosterone and cortisol, and how they interact with oxytocin and might\
  \ change its behavioral effects. And, finally, we talk about how we can foster trust\
  \ in companies and other sorts of human organizations, reduce stress, increase productivity,\
  \ and empower employees.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:55 What is neuroeconomics?</p>\n\
