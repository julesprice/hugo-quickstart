shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 15th 2021.  \nDr. Francis McAndrew is the Cornelia\
  \ H. Dudley Professor of Psychology at Knox College. He studies human social behavior\
  \ from an evolutionary perspective. He is especially interested in understanding\
  \ the psychology of everyday life. Why do we enjoy gossip about celebrities? Why\
  \ do some people name their children after themselves while others do not?  His\
  \ current research projects are concerned with aggression, gossip, and creepiness,\
  \ and he writes a blog for Psychology Today Magazine titled \"Out of the Ooze: Navigating\
  \ the 21st Century with a Stone-Age Mind.\" Dr. McAndrew is also interested in environmental\
  \ psychology, which is the study of the relationship between people and their physical\
  \ environments, both natural and human-made. He has written a successful textbook\
  \ in this area, Environmental Psychology.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about gossip,\
  \ namesaking, creepiness, and aggression, all from an evolutionary perspective.\
