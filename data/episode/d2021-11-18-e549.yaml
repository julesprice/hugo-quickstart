shownotes: "<p>Dr. Arvid \xC5gren is Wenner-Gren Fellow in the Department of Evolutionary\
  \ Biology at Uppsala University. He is an evolutionary biologist studying genomic\
  \ conflicts. He is the author of The Gene's-Eye View of Evolution.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we focus on The Gene's-Eye View of Evolution. We first introduce the\
  \ idea, and walk-through concepts like the \u201Cselfish gene\u201D, and the replicator-vehicle\
  \ approach. We get into the debate surrounding levels of selection, and inclusive\
  \ fitness theory and group selection. We talk about what evolutionary biologists\
  \ think about the gene\u2019s-eye view of evolution, and the best alternatives to\
  \ it. We discuss the relationship between this perspective and adaptationism, and\
  \ how it makes sense of phenomena like pleiotropy, polygeny, and sexual selection.\
  \ We discuss some limitations of it when dealing with developmental biology. We\
  \ talk about cultural selection, and if memetics has been successful as a scientific\
  \ discipline. Finally, we talk about what the gene\u2019s-eye view of evolution\
  \ might have to say about human nature, and the moral nature of the Universe.</p>\n"
