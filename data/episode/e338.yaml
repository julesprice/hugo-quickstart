  \ a member of the Management of Organizations group, at UC Berkeley. Prior to Haas,\
  \ Dr. Moore served on the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Tepper School\
  \ of Business, where he held the Carnegie Bosch chair. His research interests focus\
  \ on overconfidence, including when people think they\u2019re better than they are,\
  \ when they think they are better than others, and when they are too sure they know\
  \ the truth. He\u2019s the author of a new book, Perfectly Confident: How To Calibrate\
  \ Your Decisions Wisely.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Dr. Moore\u2019s new book,\
  \ and talk about confidence, overconfidence, and underconfidence. We also refer\
  \ to the above-average effect, ambiguity aversion and risk aversion, overprecision,\
  \ and the different kinds of overconfidence and underconfidence. Finally, we discuss\
  \ the relationship between confidence and decision-making and emotions, and the\
  \ ways by which we can try to calibrate our decisions wisely, applying it to business,\
  \ politics, and personal relationships. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:29  What is confidence?\
