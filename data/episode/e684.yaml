shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 6th 2022.  \nDr. Patrick Lee Miller is an associate professor\
  \ of Philosophy at Duquesne University, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He is the author\
  \ of Becoming God: Pure Reason in Early Greek Philosophy (Bloomsbury, 2012), and\
  \ co-editor of Introductory Readings in Ancient Greek and Roman Philosophy (Hackett,\
  \ 2015).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about Nietzsche and Plato. We start by talking\
  \ about Nietzsche\u2019s phases in his writings, and ask if The Will to Power should\
  \ be considered canon. We discuss why we can compare Nietzsche and Plato. And then\
  \ we get into some of the aspects of their philosophies, and where they diverge\
  \ and converge, including: the Dionysian, the Apollonian, and the Greek poets; their\
  \ metaphysics; the Eternal Return, and time as linear or circular; slave and master\
  \ morality; Plato\u2019s Republic, hierarchy, and democracy; and the differences\
  \ between the Philosopher King and the \xDCbermensch.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
