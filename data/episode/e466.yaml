shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 9th 2021.  \nDr. Bart J. Wilson is the Donald P.\
  \ Kennedy Endowed Chair in Economics and Law at Chapman University. He is a founding\
  \ member of the Economic Science Institute and founding member and Director of the\
  \ Smith Institute for Political Economy and Philosophy. His research uses experimental\
  \ economics to explore the foundations of exchange and specialization and the origins\
  \ of property. Another of his research programs compares decision making in humans,\
  \ apes, and monkeys. In 2019 he co-authored with Vernon Smith a Cambridge University\
  \ Press book entitled, \"Humanomics: Moral Sentiments and the Wealth of Nations\
  \ for the Twenty-First Century.\" He is the author of The Property Species: Mine,\
  \ Yours, and the Human Mind.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Property Species,\
  \ and talk about Dr. Wilson\u2019s work on this subject more broadly. We first discuss\
  \ property from an evolutionary perspective, and the endowment effect. We ask if\
  \ property is a human universal. We then talk about sharing, exchange, trade, and\
  \ specialization. We discuss some features of the human mind that play a role in\
  \ how we think about property, like abstract thinking, language, and morality. Dr.\
  \ Wilson explains the difference between property and property rights. We also talk\
  \ about intellectual property, and what we can learn about human sociality (focusing\
  \ on how people cooperate) by studying how people think about property. Finally,\
  \ we ask if anarchy could ever work, why social preferences are not preferences,\
  \ and some thoughts on the so-called \u201Csharing economy\u201D.\n\nTime Links:\
