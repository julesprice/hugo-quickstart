  \ styles, and also mate guarding and mate retention strategies. We first refer to\
  \ the many dimensions of human mating, and the innate and environmental aspects\
  \ of it. Then, we talk about the types of attachment that we have, and how they\
  \ related to how we establish romantic relationships. We also refer to the specific\
  \ case of coalitional mate retention strategies. Finally, we discuss the role of\
  \ marriage and children in romantic relationships, and pair-bonding, parental investment\
  \ and cooperative breeding in humans.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Nicole\u2019\
