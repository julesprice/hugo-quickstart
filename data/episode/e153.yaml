shownotes: "Dr. Jessica Pierce is an American bioethicist, philosopher, and writer.\
  \ She currently has a loose affiliation with the Center for Bioethics and Humanities,\
  \ University of Colorado Denver, but considers herself mostly independent. She has\
  \ previously worked variously at the University of Colorado Boulder, the University\
  \ of Nebraska Medical Center, and Randolph-Macon Women's College, having studied\
  \ at the University of Virginia, Harvard Divinity School and Scripps College. Early\
  \ in her career, she focused on questions of human health and the environment, co-authoring\
  \ Environmentalism and the New Logic of Business (Oxford, 2000) and The Ethics of\
  \ Environmentally Responsible Health Care (Oxford, 2004). Since the 2000s, much\
  \ of her work has focused on human relationships with animals. She collaborated\
  \ with Marc Bekoff for Wild Justice (Chicago, 2010), and authored The Last Walk\
  \ (Chicago, 2012), Run, Spot, Run (Chicago, 2016), and The Animals' Agenda: Freedom,\
  \ Compassion, and Coexistence in the Human Age (2017).\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about animal ethics. First, we focus on the biological bases of morality and their\
  \ importance to animal ethics, and some aspects of animal psychology that might\
  \ be particularly relevant to the discussion, like consciousness and empathy. In\
  \ the second part of the interview, we talk about specific topics, like animal research\
  \ and testing in science, animal conservation in zoos and aquaria, and the food\
  \ industry and veganism. Finally, Dr. Pierce gives us an overview of the research\
  \ she is doing with Dr. Marc Bekoff for a new book, that is tentatively titled \u201C\
  A Dogs\u2019 World\u201D, and also a short teaser to a book that she will release\
  \ next month, \u201CUnleashing Your Dog\u201D. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:20  The importance\
