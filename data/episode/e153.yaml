shownotes: "<p>Dr. Jessica Pierce is an American bioethicist, philosopher, and writer.\
  \ She currently has a loose affiliation with the Center for Bioethics and Humanities,\
  \ University of Colorado Denver, but considers herself mostly independent. She has\
  \ previously worked variously at the University of Colorado Boulder, the University\
  \ of Nebraska Medical Center, and Randolph-Macon Women's College, having studied\
  \ at the University of Virginia, Harvard Divinity School and Scripps College. Early\
  \ in her career, she focused on questions of human health and the environment, co-authoring\
  \ Environmentalism and the New Logic of Business (Oxford, 2000) and The Ethics of\
  \ Environmentally Responsible Health Care (Oxford, 2004). Since the 2000s, much\
  \ of her work has focused on human relationships with animals. She collaborated\
  \ with Marc Bekoff for Wild Justice (Chicago, 2010), and authored The Last Walk\
  \ (Chicago, 2012), Run, Spot, Run (Chicago, 2016), and The Animals' Agenda: Freedom,\
  \ Compassion, and Coexistence in the Human Age (2017).</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we talk about animal ethics. First, we focus on the biological bases of morality\
  \ and their importance to animal ethics, and some aspects of animal psychology that\
  \ might be particularly relevant to the discussion, like consciousness and empathy.\
  \ In the second part of the interview, we talk about specific topics, like animal\
  \ research and testing in science, animal conservation in zoos and aquaria, and\
  \ the food industry and veganism. Finally, Dr. Pierce gives us an overview of the\
  \ research she is doing with Dr. Marc Bekoff for a new book, that is tentatively\
  \ titled \u201CA Dogs\u2019 World\u201D, and also a short teaser to a book that\
  \ she will release next month, \u201CUnleashing Your Dog\u201D.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n\
