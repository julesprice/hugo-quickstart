  <p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Human Extinction. We start by discussing\
  \ how old the idea of human extinction is in Western history. We then talk about\
  \ five existential moods across history, and get into anthropogenic extinction,\
  \ natural causes of extinction, and the existential mood of our current moment.\
  \ We discuss what people might mean by \u201Chuman\u201D and \u201Cextinction\u201D\
  . Finally, we talk about ideas in favor of human extinction.</p>\n"
