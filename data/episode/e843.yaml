shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 28th 2023.  \nDr. \xC9mile Torres is a researcher at\
  \ Leibniz Universit\xE4t Hannover, in Germany. Their work over the past decade has\
  \ centered around a single theme: eschatology, whether religious, secular, or scientific.\
  \ Recently, their work has been focused on the nature and causes of human extinction,\
  \ its ethical implications, and the history of the idea.  They are the author of\
  \ Morality, Foresight, and Human Flourishing: An Introduction to Existential Risks,\
  \ and their latest book is Human Extinction: A History of the Science and Ethics\
  \ of Annihilation.\n\nThis is our second interview. You can watch the first one,\
  \ on the philosophy of effective altruism and longtermism, here: https://youtu.be/ES-fPqMXXng\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on Human Extinction. We start by discussing how old\
  \ the idea of human extinction is in Western history. We then talk about five existential\
  \ moods across history, and get into anthropogenic extinction, natural causes of\
  \ extinction, and the existential mood of our current moment. We discuss what people\
  \ might mean by \u201Chuman\u201D and \u201Cextinction\u201D. Finally, we talk about\
  \ ideas in favor of human extinction.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:29  How\
