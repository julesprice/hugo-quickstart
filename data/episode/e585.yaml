shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 1st 2021.  \nDr. Philippe Rochat is Professor of\
  \ Psychology at Emory University. What is the nature and origins of human self-conscious\
  \ psychology? Driven by this question, the main focus of Dr. Rochat's research in\
  \ the Emory Infant and Child Lab is on the early sense of self, emerging self-concept,\
  \ the development of social cognition and relatedness, and the emergence of a moral\
  \ sense during the preschool years in children from all over the world growing up\
  \ in different cultural environments and socio-economic circumstances. Dr. Rochat\
  \ has published five books, including Moral Acrobatics: How We Avoid Ethical Ambiguity\
  \ by Thinking in Black and White.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Moral Acrobatics.\
  \ The topics covered include: black-and-white thinking; three forces: in-group favoritism\
  \ (parochialism), the basic need to affiliate; the struggle for recognition (reputation);\
  \ essentialism; the fundamental attribution error; ethical ambiguity and how we\
  \ avoid it; the developmental psychology of lying; legal systems; individual differences\
  \ in moral acrobatics; and if it is possible for us to become better people by learning\
  \ about moral development.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:31  Black-and-white\
