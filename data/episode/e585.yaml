shownotes: '<p>Dr. Philippe Rochat is Professor of Psychology at Emory University.
  What is the nature and origins of human self-conscious psychology? Driven by this
  question, the main focus of Dr. Rochat''s research in the Emory Infant and Child
  Lab is on the early sense of self, emerging self-concept, the development of social
  cognition and relatedness, and the emergence of a moral sense during the preschool
  years in children from all over the world growing up in different cultural environments
  and socio-economic circumstances. Dr. Rochat has published five books, including
  Moral Acrobatics: How We Avoid Ethical Ambiguity by Thinking in Black and White.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on Moral Acrobatics. The topics covered include: black-and-white
  thinking; three forces: in-group favoritism (parochialism), the basic need to affiliate;
  the struggle for recognition (reputation); essentialism; the fundamental attribution
  error; ethical ambiguity and how we avoid it; the developmental psychology of lying;
  legal systems; individual differences in moral acrobatics; and if it is possible
  for us to become better people by learning about moral development.</p>
