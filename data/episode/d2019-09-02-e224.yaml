shownotes: "<p>Dr. Michele Gelfand is a Distinguished University Professor at the\
  \ University of Maryland, College Park. She uses field, experimental, computational,\
  \ and neuroscience methods to understand the evolution of culture--as well as its\
  \ multilevel consequences for human groups. Her work has been cited over 20,000\
  \ times and has been featured in the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Boston\
  \ Globe, National Public Radio, Voice of America, Fox News, NBC News, ABC News,\
  \ The Economist, among other outlets. She is the author of Rule Makers, Rule Breakers:\
  \ How Tight and Loose Cultures Wire the World (Scribner, 2018).</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we focus on some of the main topics of Dr. Gelfand\u2019s book, Rule\
  \ Markers, Rule Breakers. Dr. Gelfand gives us a definition of tight and loose culture,\
  \ and then we explore the several different aspects that go associated with the\
  \ tightness-looseness continuum. We explore its relationship with other ways of\
  \ approaching culture, like the individualism-collectivism continuum, and if there\
  \ is any relationship with the Big Five personality traits. We also refer to the\
  \ divide in the US between the northern and the southern states. We talk about how\
  \ normative behavior arises in early stages of development in children. Toward the\
  \ end, we discuss the relationship between tightness and looseness and some health\
  \ outcomes, and how we can use this framework to potentially solve some relevant\
  \ contemporary issues, like political polarization.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow\
