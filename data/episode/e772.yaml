  \ of conspiracy thinking. We talk about the role of political extremism and partisanship\
  \ in conspiracy thinking, and how conspiracy theories can be associated with anti-democratic\
  \ impulses. We discuss partisan and ideological identities versus anti-establishment\
  \ orientations. We talk about how beliefs about the 2020 election fraud conspiracy\
  \ theory changed over time. We discuss if exposure to conspiracy theories has any\
  \ causal power over belief, and if we know how conspiracy theories develop and spread.\
  \ We also discuss if there are more conspiracy theories today, and the relationship\
  \ between conspiracy theory beliefs and vaccine hesitancy. Finally, we talk about\
  \ how worried we should be about conspiracy theories and misinformation.</p>\n"
