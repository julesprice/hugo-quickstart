  \ is Quit: The Power of Knowing When to Walk Away.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus\
  \ on Quit. We start by talking about grit and quit, and how they can complement\
  \ each other. We discuss if \u201Cnever quit\u201D is ever a good message, and the\
  \ social stigma associated with quitting. We talk about planning for quitting, dealing\
  \ with the \u201Cwhat-ifs\u201D, and setting \u201Ckiller criteria\u201D. We go\
  \ through the psychological effects that make it harder to quit, including loss\
  \ aversion, the sunk cost fallacy, the endowment effect, personal identity, and\
  \ setting goals. We discuss how other people can help us quit. Finally, we talk\
  \ about how this all applies in the context of poker playing.</p>\n"
