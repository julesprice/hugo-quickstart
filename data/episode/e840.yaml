shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 18th 2023.  \nDr. Alicia Juarrero is President and\
  \ Founder of VectorAnalytica. Her research in neurophilosophy has been focused on\
  \ the causal role of context-sensitive constraints in the emergence of mental events\
  \ such as intentions. She is the author of several books, the most recent one being\
  \ Context Changes Everything: How Constraints Create Coherence.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on Context Changes Everything. We start by discussing the problem of\
  \ identity, how change is compatible with remaining the same, and why Western science\
  \ and philosophy cannot deal with the relations between parts and wholes. We talk\
  \ about coherence, the problem of causation, and Aristotle\u2019s four causes. We\
  \ discuss what constraints are, and talk about context-independent and context-dependent\
  \ constraints, and how they apply to the study of infectious diseases. We talk about\
  \ identity theory, and multiple realizability in neuroscience. Finally, we discuss\
  \ 4E cognition, and how intentions, thoughts, and beliefs can cause anything.\n\n\
