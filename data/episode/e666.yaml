shownotes: '<p>Dr. Luana Maroja is Professor of Biology at Williams College. She is
  interested in the evolution of barriers to gene exchange, speciation, population
  genetics and phylogeography. Her study systems are crickets (Gryllus), artic plants
  and butterflies (heliconius).</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about gene exchange, adaptation, speciation, and phylogeography.
  We start with gene exchange, and talk about how it occurs, gene transfers between
  species, and barriers to gene exchange. We talk about modular expression of genes.
  We discuss adaptations, how we can understand their evolution, and how to identify
  genes associated with them. We talk about speciation, and how we know it is occurring.
  We also talk about phylogeography, landscape genetics, and what leads to more diversity
  of species.</p>
