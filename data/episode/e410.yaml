shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 12th 2020.  \nDr. Edward Watts is presently the Vassiliadis\
  \ Professor of Byzantine Greek History at UC San Diego, where he was formerly Co-Director\
  \ of the Center for Hellenic Studies. His research interests center on the intellectual\
  \ and religious history of the Roman Empire and the early Byzantine Empire. He is\
  \ the author of several books on ancient history, the most recent one being Mortal\
  \ Republic: How Rome Fell Into Tyranny. He also has a new book coming out in 2021,\
  \ The Eternal Decline and Fall of Rome: The History of a Dangerous Idea.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on Mortal Republic. We go through the several different political\
  \ organizations that Rome had \u2013 the kingdom, the republic, and the empire -,\
  \ and some of their major players, like the patricians, the Gracchi brothers (Tiberius\
  \ and Gaius), and Julius Caesar. We then ask if there are any lessons we can take\
  \ from the Roman Republic for modern politics, Great-Man vs. Great-Ideas theories\
  \ of History, and if History really does repeat itself.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:05\
