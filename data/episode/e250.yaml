shownotes: "Dr. Rachel Kleinfeld is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for\
  \ International Peace. She\u2019s a leading expert on how democracies \u2013 including\
  \ the United States \u2013 can improve, with a particular focus on countries facing\
  \ poor leadership, polarized populations, violence, and corruption. She advises\
  \ governments, philanthropists, and activists on how democracies make major social\
  \ change. In 2010, Time magazine named Dr. Kleinfeld one of the top 40 political\
  \ leaders under 40 in America. She serves on the boards of various for-profit companies\
  \ and social sector organizations that align with her passion for issues on the\
  \ intersections of security, human dignity, and empowerment. From 2011\u20132014\
  \ she served on the State Department\u2019s Foreign Affairs Policy Board, which\
  \ advised the Secretary of State quarterly. She\u2019s the author of three books,\
  \ the most recent one being A Savage Order: How the World's Deadliest Countries\
  \ Can Forge a Path to Security.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Dr. Kleinfeld\u2019\
  s book, A Savage Order. We talk about different types of political violence, and\
  \ how they interrelate, including what Dr. Kleinfeld calls \u201Cprivilege violence\u201D\
  , and we refer to how violence against blacks was legitimized in the US after the\
  \ civil war. We also discuss the decivilizing process, dirty deals, and the recivilizing\
  \ process and why the middle class is so important in the latter. Toward the end,\
  \ we also talk about the policies adopted in Georgia to systemically fighting against\
  \ corruption, and also why we have to go beyond culture to understand violence,\
  \ and also to deal with current political issues like mass migration, multiculturalism,\
  \ and Islam.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:06  The premise of A Savage Order  \n03:14  Different\
