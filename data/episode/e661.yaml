  \ Kristina Durante is an evolutionary psychologist and Professor of Marketing, Marketing\
  \ Department Vice Chair, and the marketing Ph.D. program coordinator at Rutgers\
  \ Business School. She is a social psychologist interested in the biology of decision-making.Her\
  \ areas of expertise include women\u2019s consumer choice and luxury spending, family\
  \ consumer decisions, hormones and behavior, and the psychological consequences\
  \ of ambiguity.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about the complicated trade-off\
  \ women many times have to make between family and career in modern industrialized\
  \ societies. We talk about the role of fathers and arranged marriages in our evolutionary\
  \ history. We question if women really have an impulse to want children. We discuss\
  \ gender norms and the sexual division of labor, and the negative impacts they might\
  \ have. We get into the trade-off between career and family, and how modern societies\
  \ lack incentives and opportunities for women to invest in both. We talk about the\
  \ negative effects the pandemic had on families and careers. Finally, we discuss\
  \ how evolutionary psychology can help women deal with this trade-off.</p>\n"
