shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 22nd 2020.  \nDr. Kristina Durante is an evolutionary\
  \ psychologist and Professor of Marketing, Marketing Department Vice Chair, and\
  \ the marketing Ph.D. program coordinator at Rutgers Business School. She is a social\
  \ psychologist interested in the biology of decision-making. Her research lies at\
  \ the intersection of social psychology, evolutionary biology, and consumer decision-making.\
  \ Her areas of expertise include women\u2019s consumer choice and luxury spending,\
  \ family consumer decisions, hormones and behavior, and the psychological consequences\
  \ of ambiguity.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the complicated trade-off women\
  \ many times have to make between family and career in modern industrialized societies.\
  \ We talk about the role of fathers and arranged marriages in our evolutionary history.\
  \ We question if women really have an impulse to want children. We discuss gender\
  \ norms and the sexual division of labor, and the negative impacts they might have.\
  \ We get into the trade-off between career and family, and how modern societies\
  \ lack incentives and opportunities for women to invest in both. We talk about the\
  \ negative effects the pandemic had on families and careers. Finally, we discuss\
  \ how evolutionary psychology can help women deal with this trade-off.\n\nTime Links:\
