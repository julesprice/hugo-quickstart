  \ research for two decades on regional society in Japan, based on extensive fieldwork\
  \ in the Sh\u014Dnai area of Yamagata Prefecture. He has also written widely on\
  \ the broader dynamics of class formation in Japanese society. At the same time,\
  \ much of his research for the past two decades has explored sport and body culture\
  \ and their significance in modern Japan. He has also written on the history of\
  \ Japan anthropology and its importance for Japan studies and for sociocultural\
  \ anthropology.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about topics in the\
  \ sociocultural anthropology of Japan. We discuss the work Dr. Kelly has done on\
  \ the social organization of the Japanese countryside, particularly in the Sh\u014D\
  nai area, and how it might generalize to the rest of Japan. We talk about Tokugawa\
  \ Japan. We discuss class formation and hierarchy in Japan. We talk about the Japanese\
  \ economic crisis of the late 80s/early 90s, and some social and economic challenges\
  \ in contemporary Japan, focusing on singlehood, the hikikomori, and suicide rates.\
  \ We discuss the study of sports culture, and how it ties to body culture, geopolitics,\
  \ gender, and race. Finally, we talk about the role and contribution of ethnography\
  \ and sociocultural anthropology to social science inquiry.</p>\n"
