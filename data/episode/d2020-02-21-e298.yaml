shownotes: "<p>Dr. Michael Inzlicht is a Research Excellence Faculty Scholar at the\
  \ University of Toronto. His primary appointment is as Professor in the Department\
  \ of Psychology, but he is also cross-appointed as Professor at the Rotman School\
  \ of Management. Dr. Inzlicht conducts research that sits at the boundaries of social\
  \ psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience. Although he has published papers\
  \ on the topics of prejudice, academic performance, and religion, his most recent\
  \ interests have been in the topics of self-control, where he borrows methods from\
  \ affective and cognitive neuroscience to understand the underlying nature of self-control,\
  \ including how it is driven by motivation.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus most\
  \ of our conversation of self-control and things related to it. First, I ask about\
  \ social neuroscience, and what Dr. Inzlicht thinks are the kinds of insights we\
  \ can get from neuroscience about social psychology phenomena. We then get into\
  \ self-control, and talk about what is it, and the concept of self-control strength.\
  \ We address a paper from 2018 that tried to replicate Walter Mischel\u2019s marshmallow\
  \ test, and the capacity to delay gratification. We also refer to one aspect of\
  \ the recent APA guidelines for psychological practice with men and boys, namely\
  \ the repression/suppression of emotions. Still about self-control, we discuss the\
  \ interplay between emotion and cognition, the life outcomes associated with this\
  \ ability, and if there are any good interventions proven to improve it. We then\
  \ tackle aspects of the replication crisis in Psychology, and go through some examples\
  \ of phenomena that have recently been questioned, like the ego-depletion effect\
  \ and stereotype threat.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Inzlicht\u2019s work:</p>\n\
