  This show is sponsored by Enlites, Learning & Development done differently. Check\
  \ the website here: http://enlites.com/\n\nRECORDED ON JUNE 26th 2023.\nDr. Frank\
  \ Keil is Charles C. & Dorathea S. Dilley Professor of Psychology & Linguistics\
  \ and Director of the Cognition and Development lab at Yale University. At the most\
  \ general level, he is interested in how we come to make sense of the world around\
  \ us. One set of his studies is examining a level of explanatory insight that functions\
  \ without knowledge of specific mechanisms and instead involves knowing what sorts\
  \ of properties are causally potent in a domain and how they are likely to interact.\
  \ He also asks how emerging knowledge of concrete mechanisms can link up frequency-based\
  \ information with abstract explanatory principles as well as cause distortions\
  \ in judgment. He is the author of Developmental Psychology: The Growth of Mind\
  \ and Behavior, and other books.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about topics in developmental\
  \ psychology. We talk about how causal thinking develops, and its relationship with\
  \ mechanistic thinking. We discuss explanation, and the development of explanation\
  \ schema. We discuss if we are Bayesian reasoners. We discuss if scient is intuitive,\
  \ the concept of \u201Cfolk science\u201D, the cultural division of labor, and if\
  \ the thinking of scientists is much different from that of laypeople. Finally,\
  \ we talk about how developmental research can inform the study of cognition in\
  \ adults, and how developmental psychology applies across the lifespan.\n\nTime\
