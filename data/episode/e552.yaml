shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 11th 2021.  \nDr. Katarzyna (Kate) P. Adamala is a\
  \ synthetic biologist and a professor of genetics at the University of Minnesota.\
  \ Dr. Adamala's work includes contributions to the field of astrobiology, synthetic\
  \ cell engineering, and biocomputing. Her research on prebiotic RNA replication\
  \ provided an experimental scenario for the RNA world hypothesis of the origin of\
  \ life. She has worked on constructing liposome bioreactor synthetic cells. She\
  \ is a founder and steering group member of the Build-a-Cell Initiative, an international\
  \ collaboration for creation of synthetic live cells. She is a co-founder of synthetic\
  \ cell company Synlife. Adamala and Szostak demonstrated non enzymatic RNA replication\
  \ in primitive protocells is only possibly in presence of weak cation chelator like\
  \ citric acid, providing further evidence for the central role of citric acid in\
  \ primordial metabolism.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about synthetic biology. We\
  \ discuss what is a synthetic cell, and how we can use it to study cell evolution\
  \ and cell functions. We talk about the origin of life of Earth, and some of the\
  \ theories out there. We also talk about cells before the Last Universal Common\
  \ Ancestor (LUCA), and how to study cell evolution in the lab. Finally, we talk\
  \ about the Build-a-Cell Initiative, and some of the main applications of synthetic\
  \ cells, like basic research, biomanufacturing, medicine, space exploration, and\
  \ astrobiology.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:31  What is a synthetic cell?\
