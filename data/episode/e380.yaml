shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 22nd, 2020.  \nDr. Gordon Pennycook is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Behavioural Science at University of Regina\u2019s Hill/Levene Schools of Business.\
  \ He\u2019s also an Associate Member of the Department of Psychology. He\u2019s\
  \ a member of the editorial board for Thinking & Reasoning and a consulting editor\
  \ for Judgment and Decision Making. His research focus is on reasoning and decision-making,\
  \ broadly defined. He investigates the distinction between intuitive processes (\u201C\
  gut feelings\u201D) and more deliberative (\u201Canalytic\u201D) reasoning processes\
  \ and is principally interested in the causes (a) and consequences (b) of analytic\
  \ thinking. Dr. Pennycook has published on religious belief, sleep paralysis, morality,\
  \ creativity, smartphone use, health beliefs (e.g., homeopathy), language use among\
  \ climate change deniers, pseudo-profound bullshit, delusional ideation, fake news\
  \ (and disinformation more broadly), political ideology, and science beliefs. He\u2019\
  s also interested in the methodological and theoretical issues that pertain to the\
  \ measurement of cognitive reflection and motivated reasoning.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we first talk about dual-process theory, reasoning and rationality, motivated\
  \ reasoning, the Dunning-Kruger effect, and the analytic cognitive style and ability.\
  \ We then go through what characterizes pseudo-profound bullshit in terms of discourse,\
  \ the language of climate change deniers, and fake news and misinformation (particularly\
  \ on the internet).\n\nTime Links:  \n01:28  Differences between intuitive processes\
  \ and deliberative reasoning processes  \n08:05  Does analytic thinking lead to\
