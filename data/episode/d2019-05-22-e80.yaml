  \ From Rousseau to the Present\u201D: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rBTPMBKCZLs\">https://youtu.be/rBTPMBKCZLs</a></p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we focus on Nietzsche\u2019s philosophy, and some of Dr. Hicks\u2019\
  \ views about it, as exposed in his book, \u201CNietzsche and the Nazis\u201D. As\
  \ the title of the book implies, we talk about how Nietzsche might have influenced\
  \ the German National-Socialist political ideology, and, toward the end, we also\
  \ get a little bit into the connections between Nazism and Postmodernism, and how\
  \ Nietzsche was one of the major influences in both these political opposite ideologies.\
  \ Specific topics include Nietzsche\u2019s reactionary views against the values\
  \ of the Enlightenment, namely rationality and objectivity, individualism, progress,\
  \ and science as whole.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:59 Nietzsche\u2019s take\
