shownotes: "<p>Dr. Zanna Clay is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology\
  \ at Durham University. She is a comparative and developmental psychologist with\
  \ expertise in primatology. She studies and compares great apes and young children\
  \ in order to investigate the evolutionary and developmental basis of hominid social\
  \ cognition and behavior. Her main interests are the development &amp; evolution\
  \ of social cognition and communication, focusing on empathy, language and social\
  \ learning.</p>\n<p>In this episode, We focus mostly on bonobo societies and their\
  \ behavior. We talk first about their sociality. Then we go through the different\
  \ types of calls that they have, related to food, alarm calls, and sex. We also\
  \ ask how far back in evolution do vocalizations go, and the cognitive tools needed\
  \ to produce them, and also about a possible phylogenetic relationship between animal\
  \ vocalizations and human language. We explore the social functions of sex in bonobo\
  \ societies. We also discuss socio-emotional competence in bonobos, and how we can\
  \ compare their development with the one of human infants. Finally, we address the\
  \ question if there is a best primate (great Ape) model to compare to humans.</p>\n\
