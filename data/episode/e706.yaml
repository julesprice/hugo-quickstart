shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 16th 2022.  \nDr. Wiebke Bleidorn is a Professor\
  \ of Psychology at the University of Zurich. Dr. Bleidorn examines the conditions,\
  \ mechanisms, and consequences of personality change. Personality change is an emerging\
  \ subfield that straddles the areas of personality, developmental, and social psychology.\
  \ Dr. Bleidorn's work sits at this intersection. Her current research involves questions\
  \ about the cultural and social conditions under which people change, the genetic\
  \ and environmental mechanisms that account for change, and the consequences of\
  \ these changes for psychological functioning and important life outcomes.\n\nIn\
  \ this episode, we talk about personality changes. We first contextualize the conversation,\
  \ by talking about the Big Five personality traits and their structure. We talk\
  \ about the heritability of these traits, and how they are influenced by the environment.\
  \ We get into personality plasticity, and go through individual differences in it;\
  \ patterns in personality changes across the lifespan; the transition to adulthood,\
  \ and the transition to parenthood; and the impact of life events. Finally, we discuss\
  \ if people can deliberately change their personality.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
