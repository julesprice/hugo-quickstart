shownotes: '<p>Dr. Wiebke Bleidorn is a Professor of Psychology at the University
  of Zurich. Dr. Bleidorn examines the conditions, mechanisms, and consequences of
  personality change. Personality change is an emerging subfield that straddles the
  areas of personality, developmental, and social psychology. Dr. Bleidorn''s work
  sits at this intersection. Her current research involves questions about the cultural
  and social conditions under which people change, the genetic and environmental mechanisms
  that account for change, and the consequences of these changes for psychological
  functioning and important life outcomes.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about personality changes. We first contextualize the
  conversation, by talking about the Big Five personality traits and their structure.
  We talk about the heritability of these traits, and how they are influenced by the
  environment. We get into personality plasticity, and go through individual differences
  in it; patterns in personality changes across the lifespan; the transition to adulthood,
  and the transition to parenthood; and the impact of life events. Finally, we discuss
  if people can deliberately change their personality.</p>
