shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 27th 2021.  \nDr. Eric Kaufmann is Professor of Politics\
  \ at Birkbeck College, University of London, UK.  He is principally interested in\
  \ cultural politics: ethnicity, national identity and religion. He\u2019s the author\
  \ of Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration, and the Future of White Majorities.\n\n\
  In this episode, we focus on Whiteshift. First, Dr. Kaufmann tells us about the\
  \ main thesis of the book. We discuss the relationship between ethnicity and culture,\
  \ and the relationship between ethnic identity and politics. We go through some\
  \ of the factors behind the rise of the populist right, including the migration\
  \ crisis, Muslim terrorism, and the 2008 economic crisis. We talk about different\
  \ strategies to deal with immigrants. We speculate a bit about the possible future\
  \ of the European Union. We ask if it is possible to have countries without borders,\
  \ and if multiculturalism works. We end with a teaser to our possible second conversation,\
  \ and talk about the relationship between religion and demography.\n\nTime Links:\
