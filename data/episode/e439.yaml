shownotes: "<p>Dr. Eric Kaufmann is Professor of Politics at Birkbeck College, University\
  \ of London, UK. &nbsp;He is principally interested in cultural politics: ethnicity,\
  \ national identity and religion. He\u2019s the author of Whiteshift: Populism,\
  \ Immigration, and the Future of White Majorities.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus\
  \ on Whiteshift. First, Dr. Kaufmann tells us about the main thesis of the book.\
  \ We discuss the relationship between ethnicity and culture, and the relationship\
  \ between ethnic identity and politics. We go through some of the factors behind\
  \ the rise of the populist right, including the migration crisis, Muslim terrorism,\
  \ and the 2008 economic crisis. We talk about different strategies to deal with\
  \ immigrants. We speculate a bit about the possible future of the European Union.\
  \ We ask if it is possible to have countries without borders, and if multiculturalism\
  \ works. We end with a teaser to our possible second conversation, and talk about\
  \ the relationship between religion and demography.</p>\n"
