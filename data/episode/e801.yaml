  \ and society.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about implicit attitudes and meta-perceptions,\
  \ and how they apply to politics and morality. We start by discussing what implicit\
  \ attitudes are, and how they are studied and measured. We talk about social judgments\
  \ of other people\u2019s preferences, and their accuracy. We discuss group meta-perceptions,\
  \ how they drive negative out-group attributions, and their relationship with political\
  \ violence. We then get into social influences on moral cognition, and also talk\
  \ about meta-perceptions of morally questionable actors. Finally, we discuss misperceived\
  \ polarization and where it stems from, and strategies to address political polarization.</p>\n"
