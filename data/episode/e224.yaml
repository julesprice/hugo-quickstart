shownotes: "Dr. Michele Gelfand is a Distinguished University Professor at the University\
  \ of Maryland, College Park. She uses field, experimental, computational, and neuroscience\
  \ methods to understand the evolution of culture--as well as its multilevel consequences\
  \ for human groups. Her work has been cited over 20,000 times and has been featured\
  \ in the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Boston Globe, National Public\
  \ Radio, Voice of America, Fox News, NBC News, ABC News, The Economist, among other\
  \ outlets. She is the author of Rule Makers, Rule Breakers: How Tight and Loose\
  \ Cultures Wire the World (Scribner, 2018).\n\nIn this episode, we focus on some\
  \ of the main topics of Dr. Gelfand\u2019s book, Rule Markers, Rule Breakers. Dr.\
  \ Gelfand gives us a definition of tight and loose culture, and then we explore\
  \ the several different aspects that go associated with the tightness-looseness\
  \ continuum. We explore its relationship with other ways of approaching culture,\
  \ like the individualism-collectivism continuum, and if there is any relationship\
  \ with the Big Five personality traits. We also refer to the divide in the US between\
  \ the northern and the southern states. We talk about how normative behavior arises\
  \ in early stages of development in children. Toward the end, we discuss the relationship\
  \ between tightness and looseness and some health outcomes, and how we can use this\
  \ framework to potentially solve some relevant contemporary issues, like political\
  \ polarization. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:05  What are tight and loose cultures?  \n\
