  The Panpsycast Philosophy Podcast. We discuss what consciousness is, why it matters,
  and philosophical approaches to it. We ask what we need consciousness for. We talk
  about the evolution of consciousness, the hard problem of consciousness, illusionism,
  panpsychism, and supernatural approaches to consciousness. Finally, we discuss what
  philosophy is about, and its relationship to science.</p>
