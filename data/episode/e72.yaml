shownotes: "Dr. Randy Thornhill is an American entomologist and evolutionary biologist.\
  \ He is a professor of biology at the University of New Mexico, and was president\
  \ of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society from 2011 to 2013. He is known for\
  \ his evolutionary explanation of rape as well as his work on insect mating systems\
  \ and the parasite-stress theory. He\u2019s the author of several books, including\
  \ A Natural History of Rape, and The Parasite-Stress Theory of Values and Sociality.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on the main topics of Dr. Thornhill\u2019s book, A Natural\
  \ History of Rape (https://tinyurl.com/yaad244x). We explore the evolutionary bases\
  \ of rape; the sex differences and optimal sexual strategies that give rise to it;\
  \ why women suffer so much from it, and the possible social consequences; what\u2019\
  s wrong with social constructionist theories of rape, and why don\u2019t really\
  \ help the victims or with its prevention; and science-based solutions to it.\n\n\
