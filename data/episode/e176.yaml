  \ Brooke is Arts &amp; Sciences Distinguished Professor of History, Professor of\
  \ Anthropology, and Director of the Ohio State University Center for Historical\
  \ Research. He is also the co-chair of the 2011-2012 Program: Disease, Health, and\
  \ Environment in Global History. In 2007-2008 he served as the president of the\
  \ Society of Historians of the Early American Republic. His teaching areas include\
  \ Early American History and Environmental History. His most recent book, Climate\
  \ Change and the Course of Global History: A Rough Journey, published in 2014, examines\
  \ the long material and natural history of the human condition.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we talk about Dr. Brooke\u2019s book, Climate Change and the Course of\
  \ Global History, and about the discipline of Environmental History. We start with\
  \ a definition of the discipline, and its objects of study, and then go through\
  \ some of the major evolutionary steps in our History, like the development of culture\
  \ and agriculture. Then we refer to how climate fluctuations played a role in the\
  \ crash of societies since the advent of agriculture, and also the role of epidemics\
  \ and war. We also talk about a recent study about how the arrival of Europeans\
  \ in the Americas contributed to the death of the death of 55 million people and\
  \ a drop in global temperatures. After that, we discuss the environmental conditions\
  \ that favored the development of the industrial revolution in Northern Europe,\
  \ and how it also might have contributed to the abolishment of slavery. Toward the\
  \ end, we talk about the Anthropocene, and human-made climate change, and how to\
  \ best tackle it, and also the relationship between Environmental History and Big\
  \ History, and using energy/energy density as a common metric from Physics to History.</p>\n\
