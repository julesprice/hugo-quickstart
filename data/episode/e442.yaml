shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 17th 2020.  \nDr. Nathan H. Lents is Professor of\
  \ Biology and director of the honors program and the campus Macaulay Honors College\
  \ program at John Jay College. Dr. Lents is noted for his work in cell biology,\
  \ genetics, and forensic science, as well as his popular science writing and blogging\
  \ on the evolution of human biology and behavior. He is the author of books like\
  \ Not So Different: Finding Human Nature in Animals, and Human Errors: A Panorama\
  \ of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes.\n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ talk about Human Errors. During the interview, we discuss many different physical,\
  \ physiological and psychological errors, including things like genetic errors,\
  \ problems with our reproduction, and cognitive biases. We start by defining them.\
  \ We also talk about the effects that modern medicine is having on our evolution;\
  \ predicting our evolutionary future; to what extent we need these errors to function\
  \ properly; sources of evidence for the fact that we are still evolving; eliminating\
  \ the errors through genetic engineering and human enhancement; the possibility\
  \ of living forever; and ways humans are better than other animals.\n\nTime Links:\
