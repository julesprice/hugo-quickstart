  <p>In this episode, we talk about Human Errors. During the interview, we discuss
  many different physical, physiological and psychological errors, including things
  like genetic errors, problems with our reproduction, and cognitive biases. We start
  by defining them. We also talk about the effects that modern medicine is having
  on our evolution; predicting our evolutionary future; to what extent we need these
  errors to function properly; sources of evidence for the fact that we are still
  evolving; eliminating the errors through genetic engineering and human enhancement;
  the possibility of living forever; and ways humans are better than other animals.</p>
