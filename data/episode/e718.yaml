shownotes: "<p>Dr. Moshe Hoffman is a Research Scientist at the Max Planck Institute\

  \ social behavior, preferences, and ideologies.</p>\n<p>Dr. Erez Yoeli is a Research\
  \ Scientist at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management, where he directs the Applied\

  \ Surprising Power of Game Theory to Explain Irrational Human Behavior.</p>\n<p>This\
  \ time, we cover topics like strategic ignorance; learning, from the perspective\
  \ of game theory; the hawk-dove game; where rights come from; why apologies work;\
  \ why people buy luxury items; why people sometimes hide positive traits of achievements;\
  \ evidence games; repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemma, and human cooperation; how to\
  \ promote cooperation and altruism; continuous vs. categorical norms, and how they\
  \ arise; and how and why people develop passions.</p>\n"
