shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 27th, 2019.  \nDr. Nadav Klein is an Assistant Professor\
  \ of Organisational Behaviour at INSEAD. His research focuses on the basic processes\
  \ of judgment that affect how people make decisions, process information, and evaluate\
  \ others and themselves. Some of the findings Nadav has explored are the surprising\
  \ reputational benefits of being a little bit nice to other people, the ability\
  \ of groups to detect lies, people's weak desire to be seen as moral and strong\
  \ desire not to be seen as immoral, and people's overestimation of how much information\
  \ they use to make decisions.\n\nIn this episode, we go through several topics in\
  \ social psychology. We start with social reputation, how we attribute it to other\
  \ people, the process of individuation, and the traits that people tend to associate\
  \ with it, namely the ones that cluster around warmth and competence. We then talk\
  \ about prosociality, bounded self-righteousness, and if people think their own\
  \ and the character of other people can change, and the kinds of changes that they\
  \ value and find more inspirational. We also briefly address if we are good lie\
  \ detectors, and why we do it better in groups. Finally, we talk about subjective\
  \ wellbeing and meaningfulness in life. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:02  What is social\
