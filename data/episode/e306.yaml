shownotes: "<p>Dr. Nadav Klein is an Assistant Professor of Organisational Behaviour\
  \ at INSEAD. His research focuses on the basic processes of judgment that affect\
  \ how people make decisions, process information, and evaluate others and themselves.\
  \ Some of the findings Nadav has explored are the surprising reputational benefits\
  \ of being a little bit nice to other people, the ability of groups to detect lies,\
  \ people's weak desire to be seen as moral and strong desire not to be seen as immoral,\
  \ and people's overestimation of how much information they use to make decisions.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we go through several topics in social psychology. We start\
  \ with social reputation, how we attribute it to other people, the process of individuation,\
  \ and the traits that people tend to associate with it, namely the ones that cluster\
  \ around warmth and competence. We then talk about prosociality, bounded self-righteousness,\
  \ and if people think their own and the character of other people can change, and\
  \ the kinds of changes that they value and find more inspirational. We also briefly\
  \ address if we are good lie detectors, and why we do it better in groups. Finally,\
  \ we talk about subjective wellbeing and meaningfulness in life.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
