shownotes: "<p>Dr. Cory Clark is an Assistant Professor of Quantitative Social Psychology\
  \ at Durham University, UK. Dr. Clark does research in Moral Psychology, Political\
  \ Psychology, Experimental Philosophy, and Motivated Cognition. She\u2019s also\
  \ the cohost of Psyphilopod.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on experimental philosophy,\
  \ moral judgment, beliefs in free will and determinism, and political bias. We first\
  \ talk about the new field of experimental philosophy, and how it differs from how\
  \ philosophy was traditionally done. We then get into some specific topics like\
  \ people\u2019s belief in free will and their need to attribute moral responsibility,\
  \ and how they deal with a deterministic view of the world that comes from science.\
  \ Also, how people judge themselves and others differently, or the fundamental attribution\
  \ error. And how liberals and conservatives think about free will, determinism and\
  \ compatibilism. We then move on to discuss biases, starting off with what is the\
  \ best way to think about them; in what ways political biases are special; and the\
  \ impact they have on science. Finally, we got through what we know about how liberals\
  \ and conservatives deal with different viewpoints and ideas, and several hypotheses\
  \ to explain where that comes from.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Clark\u2019s work:</p>\n\
