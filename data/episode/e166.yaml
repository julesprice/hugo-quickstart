shownotes: "<p>Dr. Daniel Nettle is Professor of Behavioural Science at Newcastle\
  \ University, where he is a member of the cross-disciplinary Centre for Behaviour\
  \ and Evolution. He studies a number of different topics relating to behaviour,\
  \ ageing and wellbeing. He mainly studies humans, but sometimes other animals (especially\

  \ The Science Behind Your Smile (2005), Personality: What Makes You the Way You\
  \ Are (2007), and Tyneside Neighbourhoods: Deprivation, Social Life and Social Behaviour\
  \ in One English City (2015).</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about personality\
  \ from an evolutionary perspective. We refer to the importance of individual variation\
  \ and things like behavioral flexibility. Also, the Big Five, and a couples of examples\
  \ of how such traits might have evolved, and their neuroscientific underpinnings.\
  \ Finally, how environmental effects are biologically mediated, and the ways by\
  \ which personality changes during the life course of people.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow\
