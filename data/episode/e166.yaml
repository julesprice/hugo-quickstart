shownotes: "Dr. Daniel Nettle is Professor of Behavioural Science at Newcastle University,\
  \ where he is a member of the cross-disciplinary Centre for Behaviour and Evolution.\
  \ He studies a number of different topics relating to behaviour, ageing and wellbeing.\
  \ He mainly studies humans, but sometimes other animals (especially starlings) too.\
  \ Dr. Nettle is the author of several books, most notably, Happiness: The Science\
  \ Behind Your Smile (2005), Personality: What Makes You the Way You Are (2007),\
  \ and Tyneside Neighbourhoods: Deprivation, Social Life and Social Behaviour in\
  \ One English City (2015).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about personality from an\
  \ evolutionary perspective. We refer to the importance of individual variation and\
  \ things like behavioral flexibility. Also, the Big Five, and a couples of examples\
  \ of how such traits might have evolved, and their neuroscientific underpinnings.\
  \ Finally, how environmental effects are biologically mediated, and the ways by\
  \ which personality changes during the life course of people.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
