shownotes: "<p>Dr. Joshua M. Tybur is an Associate Professor in the Department of\
  \ Experimental and Applied Psychology at VU Amsterdam. His work is dedicated to\
  \ better understanding how people solve some of the fundamental problems of life,\
  \ including avoiding infectious diseases, obtaining and retaining a mate, and navigating\
  \ the threats and affordances of interdependence. He approaches these topics with\
  \ a combination of ideas and techniques from social psychology, personality psychology,\
  \ and evolutionary biology.</p>\n<p>In this episode, I talk with Dr. Tybur about\
  \ the domains of the emotion of disgust, from an evolutionary perspective; the relationship\
  \ between disgust and morality, and between disgust and political attitudes; sex\
  \ differences in disgust sensitivity. We also talk about politics and science, and\
  \ the problem of our own political preferences contaminating scientific research,\
  \ and the importance of giving social psychology a biological basis. &nbsp;</p>\n\
