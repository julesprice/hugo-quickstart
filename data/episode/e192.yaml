  \ anthropology.</p>\n<p>In this episode, our primary focus is on sexual selection.\
  \ We start off by talking about how Darwin conceived of sexual selection, the reactions\
  \ he got to that theory, and then some of the major developments in the 20th century\
  \ that led to a full-fledged sexual selection theory, that now is at the basis of\
  \ the study of any aspects of animal behavior. The conversation eventually goes\
  \ off to group selection and multilevel selection approaches, and we talk about\
  \ cultural evolution, gene-culture coevolution, and basically the interplay between\
  \ biology and culture.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Gama Mota\u2019s work:</p>\n\
