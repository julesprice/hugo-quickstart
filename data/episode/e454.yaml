  <p>In this episode, we focus on Drunk on Genocide. We start by talking about other
  historical examples of alcohol associated with coalitional violence. We then talk
  about drinking in German society prior to the rise of the Nazi regime. We discuss
  reasons why alcohol is consumed in a context of violence. We talk about rituals
  and their psychological effects. We discuss the relationship between masculinity
  and the Nazi regime, and also their relationship with geography. We talk about how
  rituals promoted social bonding. We ask what all of this tells us about human nature.
  We discuss what was behind the rise of the Nazi regime. We talk about different
  kinds of violence perpetrated during war and in concentration camps. We also talk
  about the possible role alcohol played in suicides in the end of the Nazi regime,
  and how it was used as an alibi in the Nuremberg trials. Finally, we discuss how
  this culture of masculinity and alcohol might have played a role in Germany after
  the II World War.</p>
