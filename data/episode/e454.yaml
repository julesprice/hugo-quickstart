  \nIn this episode, we focus on Drunk on Genocide. We start by talking about other\
  \ historical examples of alcohol associated with coalitional violence. We then talk\
  \ about drinking in German society prior to the rise of the Nazi regime. We discuss\
  \ reasons why alcohol is consumed in a context of violence. We talk about rituals\
  \ and their psychological effects. We discuss the relationship between masculinity\
  \ and the Nazi regime, and also their relationship with geography. We talk about\
  \ how rituals promoted social bonding. We ask what all of this tells us about human\
  \ nature. We discuss what was behind the rise of the Nazi regime. We talk about\
  \ different kinds of violence perpetrated during war and in concentration camps.\
  \ We also talk about the possible role alcohol played in suicides in the end of\
  \ the Nazi regime, and how it was used as an alibi in the Nuremberg trials. Finally,\
  \ we discuss how this culture of masculinity and alcohol might have played a role\
  \ in Germany after the II World War.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:38  Historical\
