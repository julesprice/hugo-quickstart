  \ developmental psychology. We discuss the role that development plays in biology;\
  \ the importance of the field of evolutionary psychology; the current state of the\
  \ art of human epigenetics; behavioral genetics and the nature-nurture debate; what\
  \ is \u201Cinnate\u201D in human psychology; behavioral plasticity; our long period\
  \ of development as a species and what we acquire through it; some species-typical\
  \ mental abilities, like imitation, theory of mind and culture; the importance of\
  \ play; and implicit knowledge. We wrap up the interview by talking about evolutionary\
  \ mismatch and how we are not adapted to certain aspects of our modern environment,\
  \ and the problems that might bring; and also how we can apply this knowledge to\
  \ develop better education systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Bjorklund\u2019\
