shownotes: "Dr. David F. Bjorklund is a Professor of Psychology at Florida Atlantic\
  \ University where he teaches graduate and undergraduate courses in developmental\
  \ and evolutionary psychology. He served as Associate Editor of Child Development\
  \ (1997-2001) and is currently serving as Editor of the Journal of Experimental\
  \ Child Psychology. His books include The Origins of Human Nature: Evolutionary\
  \ Developmental Psychology (with Anthony Pellegrini), Origins of the Social Mind:\
  \ Evolutionary Psychology and Child Development (edited with Bruce Ellis), Why Youth\
  \ is Not Wasted on the Young: Immaturity in Human Development, Child and Adolescent\
  \ Development: An Integrative Approach (with Carlos Hern\xE1ndez Blasi), and Children's\
  \ Thinking: Cognitive Development and Individual Differences, now in its fifth edition.\
  \ His current research interests include children's cognitive development and evolutionary\
  \ developmental psychology.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about evolutionary developmental\
  \ psychology. We discuss the role that development plays in biology; the importance\
  \ of the field of evolutionary psychology; the current state of the art of human\
  \ epigenetics; behavioral genetics and the nature-nurture debate; what is \u201C\
  innate\u201D in human psychology; behavioral plasticity; our long period of development\
  \ as a species and what we acquire through it; some species-typical mental abilities,\
  \ like imitation, theory of mind and culture; the importance of play; and implicit\
  \ knowledge. We wrap up the interview by talking about evolutionary mismatch and\
  \ how we are not adapted to certain aspects of our modern environment, and the problems\
  \ that might bring; and also how we can apply this knowledge to develop better education\
  \ systems. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:08  Biology, development, and evolutionary psychology\
