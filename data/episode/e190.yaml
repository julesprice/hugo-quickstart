summary: In this episode, we talk about the relationship between evolutionary psychology
  and clinical psychology, and the discipline of evolutionary clinical psychology.
  We go through some major issues, like how to properly classify something as a mental
  disorder/disease; how our modern environments differ in significant ways from the
  environments we evolved in, and the problems that brings, and the phenomenon of
  evolutionary mismatch; the several different schools of thought that we have in
  clinical psychology, and if it would be possible to unify them under a core theory;
  the difficulties in objectively evaluating patients; life history strategies, and
  the problems that arise when we have unfulfilled expectations. We also talk about
  personality variation, and the relevance of personality inventories, like the Big
  Five, in a clinical context; the sociometer theory, and its explanatory power; how
  our modern obsession with happiness might be problematic. Finally, we discuss recent
  literature on the Dark Triad and the Light Triad of human nature.
