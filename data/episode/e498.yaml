shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 12th 2021.  \nDr. Kristen Syme is research associate\
  \ at the Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.\
  \ She received her BA in anthropology from the University of Delaware where she\
  \ developed an interest in using evolutionary theory to investigate mental health\
  \ and behavioral phenomena that are diagnosed and treated as diseases and deviations\
  \ according to the Western medical paradigm. She conducted her MA research on suicidal\
  \ behavior in 53 cultures and received her MA in 2014. Her research interests broadly\
  \ concern the evolved interpersonal functions of psychological and behavioral phenomena.\
  \ Her MA thesis tested two evolutionary models of suicidal behavior against the\
  \ ethnographic record, and my dissertation research is a continuation of this project.\
  \ She is presently conducting an exploratory investigation on bargaining strategies\
  \ and parent-offspring conflict with an immigrant Micronesian population in the\
  \ Vancouver WA/Portland, OR area.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about mental disorders\
  \ from an anthropological perspective, suicidal behavior, and leadership. We start\
  \ by mentioning how to think about mental disorders as cultural constructs. We discuss\
  \ mental illness in modern society. We ask if mental disorders are diseases. We\
  \ then get into suicide, and discuss it from an evolutionary perspective, including\
  \ the bargaining and inclusive fitness models of suicide. We also talk about preventing\
  \ suicide, and the power imbalance in the mental health professional/patient relationship.\
