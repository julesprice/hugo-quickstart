shownotes: "Dr. Abigail Page is MRC Research Fellow at the Department of Population\
  \ Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Her research is\
  \ focused on understanding the relationship between the environment (both social\
  \ and natural) and behavior, and ultimately how this influences health and wellbeing.\
  \ Her background is in evolutionary approaches to human behavior (in particular\
  \ Human Behavioral Ecology), therefore her research seeks to test hypotheses developed\
  \ from evolutionary theory and ultimately, to understand the function of any given\
  \ behavior. Dr. Page\u2019s interests are also influenced by Evolutionary Medicine\
  \ and Applied Evolutionary Anthropology and Demography.\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about several aspects of human sociality from a human behavioral ecology perspective.\
  \ We first discuss alloparenting, and the role of fathers. We talk about what we\
  \ can learn about human nature from traditional societies. We then get into studies\
  \ Dr. Page did with the Agta, a population of Filipino hunter-gatherers, and particularly\
  \ what happens when some of their groups adopt a more sedentary agriculture-based\
  \ lifestyle, particularly in terms of health, fertility and demography. Finally,\
  \ we talk about how we can use this knowledge to help isolated hunter-gatherer tribes\
  \ to thrive. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:05  Alloparenting in human societies  \n10:58\
