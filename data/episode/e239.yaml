shownotes: "<p>Dr. Abigail Page is MRC Research Fellow at the Department of Population\
  \ Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Her research is\
  \ focused on understanding the relationship between the environment (both social\
  \ and natural) and behavior, and ultimately how this influences health and wellbeing.\
  \ Her background is in evolutionary approaches to human behavior (in particular\
  \ Human Behavioral Ecology), therefore her research seeks to test hypotheses developed\
  \ from evolutionary theory and ultimately, to understand the function of any given\
  \ behavior. Dr. Page\u2019s interests are also influenced by Evolutionary Medicine\
  \ and Applied Evolutionary Anthropology and Demography.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we talk about several aspects of human sociality from a human behavioral ecology\
  \ perspective. We first discuss alloparenting, and the tole of fathers. We talk\
  \ about what we can learn about human nature from traditional societies. We then\
  \ get into studies Dr. Page did with the Agta, a population of Filipino hunter-gatherers,\
  \ and particularly what happens when some of their groups adopt a more sedentary\
  \ agriculture-based lifestyle, particularly in terms of health, fertility and demography.\
  \ Finally, we talk about how we can use this knowledge to help isolated hunter-gatherer\
  \ tribes to thrive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Page\u2019s work:</p>\n\
