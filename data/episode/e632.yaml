  and consilience. We discuss what human nature is, how to account for individual
  differences in human behavior, and personality. We ask if humans are an aggressive
  or peaceful species. We discuss the costs and benefits of knowledge and ignorance.
  We talk about what we can learn about human nature by studying art and literature.
  Finally, we discuss if knowledge is unitary, the concept of consilience, and how
  we can reach it.</p>
