shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 9th 2021.  \nDr. Christopher Kuzawa is Professor of Anthropology\
  \ and Faculty Fellow at the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University.\
  \ He uses principles from anthropology and evolutionary biology to gain insights\
  \ into the biological and health impacts of human developmental plasticity. His\
  \ primary field research is conducted in Cebu, the Philippines, where he works with\
  \ a large birth cohort study that enrolled more than 3,000 pregnant women in 1983\
  \ and has since followed their offspring into adulthood (now 30 years old). He uses\
  \ the nearly 3 decades of data available for each study participant, and recruitment\
  \ of generation 3 (the grandoffspring of the original mothers), to gain a better\
  \ understanding of the long-term and intergenerational impacts of early life environments\
  \ on adult biology, life history, reproduction, and health. A theme of much of his\
  \ work is the application of principles of developmental plasticity and evolutionary\
  \ biology to issues of health.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about developmental plasticity\
  \ and epigenetics. The topics covered include: early life environments and their\
  \ health impacts; brain evolution and life history; longitudinal health studies\
  \ done in the Philippines; human epigenetics; and the extended evolutionary synthesis.\n\
