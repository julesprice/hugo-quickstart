shownotes: "<p>Julian De Freitas is a cognitive scientist in the Department of Psychology\
  \ at Harvard University. He studies social intelligence, with a focus on the self,\
  \ strategic thinking, and ethics.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about the self,\
  \ morality, and common knowledge. We start by tackling the questions of what is\
  \ really the \u201Cself\u201D, and the relationship between the self and moral behavior.\
  \ Then we talk about moral judgment, the optimality bias, common intuitions about\
  \ the moral nature of the self, and morality, happiness, and the meaning of life.\
  \ We also discuss common knowledge from a cognitive scientific and game theoretical\
  \ perspectives. We refer to the relationship among common knowledge, collective\
  \ coordination, and strategic thinking; how common knowledge explains the bystander\
  \ effect better than the traditional explanation; and common knowledge and charitable\
  \ behavior. Finally, we discuss if beliefs really cause behavior.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
