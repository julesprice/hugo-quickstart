  \ friendship; friendship rivalry and its bases; the evolutionary bases of friendship;\
  \ sex differences in friendship initiation and dissolution; the studying of friendship\
  \ and mate preferences; cues and signals in mate selection, and clarifying the difference\
  \ between waist-to-hip ratio and body mass index; exaggerated physical cues and\
  \ pornography; the effects of pornography in men\u2019s minds; advantages and disadvantages\
  \ of sex robots; assortative mating, and its evolutionary advantages; a specific\
  \ study of Dr. Bleske-Rechek\u2019s involving the trolley problem; the contribution\
  \ of evolutionary psychology to human relationships; if evolutionary psychology\
  \ should be the core theory of modern Psychology, and why; if Psychology should\
