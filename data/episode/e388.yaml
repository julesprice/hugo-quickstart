shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 7th 2020.  \nDr. Warren Brown is Director of the\
  \ Lee Edwards Travis Research Institute and Professor of Psychology in the Department\
  \ of Doctoral Psychology at Fuller Theological Seminary. Currently, he is most actively\
  \ involved in neuroscience research in two areas: (1) the cognitive and psychosocial\
  \ disabilities in a congenital brain malformation called agenesis of the corpus\
  \ callosum, and (2) the consequences in adults of a childhood hemispherectomy for\
  \ the control of seizures. Brown has also studied functioning of the corpus callosum\
  \ in dyslexia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, multiple sclerosis, and\
  \ Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and he has done research on brain wave changes associated\
  \ with aging and dementia, language comprehension, dialysis treatment for kidney\
  \ disease, and attention deficits in schizophrenia. Dr. Brown has authored or coauthored\
  \ over 75 scholarly articles in such peer-reviewed scientific journals as Neuropsychologia,\
  \ Psychophysiology, Biological Psychiatry, Developmental Neuropsychology, Cortex,\
  \ Nature Review Neuroscience, and Science; 15 chapters in edited scholarly books;\
  \ and over 150 presentations at scientific meetings.\n\nIn this episode, we tackle\
  \ some major theoretical questions in neuroscience. We discuss mind-brain dualism,\
  \ reductionism and emergentism, embodied cognition, causality, and determinism and\
  \ free will. We also talk about Dr. Brown\u2019s research on the agenesis of the\
  \ corpus calossum, the neuroscience of religion, and the relationship between science\
  \ and religion.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:18  Mind-brain dualism  \n03:58  Neurobiological\
