shownotes: "<p>Dr. Suzana Herculano-Houzel is Associate Professor of Psychology and\
  \ Associate Director for Communications at Vanderbilt Brain Institute at Vanderbilt\
  \ University. She is interested in comparative neuroanatomy, cellular composition\
  \ of brains, brain morphology, brain evolution, metabolic cost of body and brain,\
  \ sleep requirement across species, feeding time, and really interested in how all\
  \ of these are tied together. She writes about neuroscience and science in general\
  \ for the public. She is the author of The Human Advantage: A New Understanding\
  \ of How Our Brain Became Remarkable (MIT Press, 2016).</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we focus on The Human Advantage, and also on a chapter of the edited book, A Most\
  \ Interesting Problem: What Darwin\u2019s Descent of Man Got Right and Wrong about\
  \ Human Evolution. We debunk many myths about the human brain, focusing on things\
  \ like its size, its number of cells, its organization, its metabolic cost, its\
  \ functions, and how we compare to other species. We also make reference to some\
  \ of the ideas Darwin exposed on The Descent of Man, and what he got right and wrong.</p>\n\
  <p>This interview is part of a short series I am doing on the 150th anniversary\
  \ of Darwin\u2019s Descent of Man.</p>\n"
