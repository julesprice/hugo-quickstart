  . We go through different delusions and domains where delusions manifest, including\
  \ self-flattering delusions, optimism and pessimism; health, and traumatic events;\
  \ superstitions, and rituals; religion; romantic relationships, and dating; self-fulfilling\
  \ prophecies; dreams; the \u201Cself\u201D; and free will, and the illusion of control.\
