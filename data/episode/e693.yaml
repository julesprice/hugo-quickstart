  \ by asking what it means to be rational. We define \u201Cdelusion\u201D. We go\
  \ through different delusions and domains where delusions manifest, including self-flattering\
  \ delusions, optimism and pessimism; health, and traumatic events; superstitions,\
  \ and rituals; religion; romantic relationships, and dating; self-fulfilling prophecies;\
  \ dreams; the \u201Cself\u201D; and free will, and the illusion of control. Finally,\
  \ we talk about instrumental rationality.</p>\n"
