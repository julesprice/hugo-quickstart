shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 12th 2020.  \nDr. Joseph Henrich is Professor and chair\
  \ of The Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. He is interested\
  \ in the question of how humans evolved from \"being a relatively unremarkable primate\
  \ a few million years ago to the most successful species on the globe\", and how\
  \ culture affected our genetic development. He is also the author of The Secret\
  \ of Our Success and The WEIRDest People in World.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ some of the main topics in Dr. Henrich\u2019s vast and interdisciplinary work.\
  \ We first discuss the trouble with trying to integrate knowledge from different\
  \ social sciences. Then, we talk about biases in cultural transmission, and genetic\
  \ and cultural evolution. We also discuss the evolution of human cooperation, how\
  \ societies scaled up, and the role of prosocial religions and Big Gods. We also\
  \ talk about the Cultural Brain Hypothesis, collective intelligence, and a cultural\
  \ evolutionary take on IQ. We characterize WEIRD psychology, comment a bit on Cecilia\
  \ Heyes\u2019 take on cultural evolutionary theory, and finally get Dr. Henrich\u2019\
  s take on group selection.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:49  An integrative approach to the\
