shownotes: "<p>Dr. Joseph Henrich is Professor and chair of The Department of Human\
  \ Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. He is interested in the question of\
  \ how humans evolved from \"being a relatively unremarkable primate a few million\
  \ years ago to the most successful species on the globe\", and how culture affected\
  \ our genetic development. He is also the author of The Secret of Our Success and\
  \ The WEIRDest People in World.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about some of the\
  \ main topics in Dr. Henrich\u2019s vast and interdisciplinary work. We first discuss\
  \ the trouble with trying to integrate knowledge from different social sciences.\
  \ Then, we talk about biases in cultural transmission, and genetic and cultural\
  \ evolution. We also discuss the evolution of human cooperation, how societies scaled\
  \ up, and the role of prosocial religions and Big Gods. We also talk about the Cultural\
  \ Brain Hypothesis, collective intelligence, and a cultural evolutionary take on\
  \ IQ. We characterize WEIRD psychology, comment a bit on Cecilia Heyes\u2019 take\
  \ on cultural evolutionary theory, and finally get Dr. Henrich\u2019s take on group\
  \ selection.</p>\n"
