shownotes: "<p>Dr. David Zaruk is the Risk-Monger. He has been an EU risk and science\
  \ communications specialist since 2000, active in EU policy events from REACH and\
  \ SCALE to the Pesticides Directive, from Science in Society questions to the use\
  \ of the Precautionary Principle. He was part of the team that set up GreenFacts\
  \ to encourage a wider use of evidence-based decision-making in the EU on environmental\
  \ health matters. Dr. Zaruk is a professor at Odisee University College where he\
  \ lectures on Communications, Marketing, EU Lobbying and PR.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we start off by talking about the tactics that bad environmental activists use,\
  \ how they oversimplify complex problems, and their anti-capitalism ideology. After\
  \ referring to the importance of experts consulting environmental and health policy,\
  \ we talk about the antiscientific approach that has been dominating the European\
  \ Union, when it comes to agriculture, energy and the environment. We then move\
  \ on to the SlimeGate series that Dr. Zaruk has been releasing, and an expos\xE9\
  \ of how tort law firms, scientists, NGOs, activists and politicians get together\
  \ to promote pseudoscience and get easy money. Toward the end, we speak about the\
  \ important difference between hazard and risk, and how fearmongers exploit people\u2019\
  s ignorance about that topic, and also about how the incidence of cancer has been\
  \ declining over time.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>01:04 Good and bad environmental\
