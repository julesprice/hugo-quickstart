  <p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on You Have More Influence Than You Think.\
  \ We discuss how much we impact other people, and go through topics like compliments;\
  \ expressing gratitude; the invisibility cloak illusion, and the spotlight effect;\
  \ what people really pay attention to; audience tuning, and the \u201Csaying-is-believing\
  \ effect\u201D; behavioral contagion; first impressions; assertiveness; the domains\
  \ where people think they are below-average; how people react to requests; why it\u2019\
  s hard to say \u201Cno\u201D, and the example of the MeToo movement; why people\
  \ in positions of power underestimate the negative impact they have on others; and\
  \ questions that should not be asked in job interviews. We talk about ways by which\
  \ we can become more aware and mindful of our influence on others. Finally, we discuss\
  \ if influencers and gurus are preying on our insecurities to sell their products.</p>\n"
