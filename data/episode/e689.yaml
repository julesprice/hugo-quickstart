shownotes: "Dr. Michael Tomasello is Emeritus Director of the Max Planck Institute\
  \ for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, and James F. Bonk Distinguished Professor\
  \ at Duke University. He is considered one of today's most authoritative developmental\
  \ and comparative psychologists. He\u2019s the author of several books, including\
  \ The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition (1999), A Natural History of Human Thinking\
  \ (2014), A Natural History of Human Morality (2016), and Becoming Human: A Theory\
  \ of Ontogeny (2019). His most recent book is The Evolution of Agency: Behavioral\
  \ Organization from Lizards to Humans.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Evolution\
  \ of Agency. We talk about agency from an evolutionary perspective, focusing on\
  \ the feedback control model of agency, and go through evolutionary history, touching\
  \ on the first animate actors, the first goal-directed agents, the first intentional\
  \ agents, the first rational agents, and the first socially normative agents. We\
  \ talk about some representatives of each of them. We discuss where goals come from,\
  \ the role of emotions, the understanding of agency in animals, social norms, and\
  \ the role of culture in collective agency. We also discuss the aspects of sociality\
  \ that are uniquely human. Finally, we talk about free will.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
