shownotes: "<p>Dr. Luke Russell is Associate Professor in the Department of Philosophy\
  \ at the University of Sydney. His research explores moral philosophy and he has\
  \ written about evil, forgiveness, virtue and vice. Dr. Russell teaches ethics,\
  \ moral psychology, and critical thinking, as well as running the University's high\
  \ school philosophy course, Mind and Morality. His new book is Being Evil: A Philosophical\
  \ Perspective.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Being Evil. We ask what evil\
  \ is, and go through several different criteria we can use to say that a particular\
  \ action or person in evil, including its extremity, the consequences, incomprehensibility,\
  \ people\u2019s reactions, the perpetrator\u2019s motives, and others. We talk about\
  \ depictions of evil in fiction, and ask if they are useful. We discuss some possible\
  \ psychological traits of evil people, and refer to Arendt\u2019s banality of evil.\
  \ Finally, we discuss if people are born evil, and what we can do to help them.</p>\n"
