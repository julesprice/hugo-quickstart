  \ Make Societies.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus mostly on the main topics of\
  \ Minds Make Societies. We start off by talking about how we need to know how minds\
  \ work if we want to understand humans create societies. To set things off, we also\
  \ refer to core knowledge, and to the flaws in the psychological literature on biases\
  \ and heuristics. We then get into how human politics evolved, and the common threads\
  \ that we find from small-scale hunter-gatherer and horticultural tribes to complex\
  \ large-scale state societies. We also go over the evolution of gender roles, and\
  \ their relationship with politics (patriarchy). In the last part of the conversation,\
  \ we discuss the evolutionary psychology of religion, and some of the methodological\
  \ problems with its approach. And we wrap it up with a question from my patron,\
  \ Yzar Wehbe, about conspiratorial thinking.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Boyer\u2019\
