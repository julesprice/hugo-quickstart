shownotes: "<p>Dr. Max Krasnow is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology\
  \ at Harvard University. His research interests include: evolutionary psychology,\
  \ evolution of sociality, psychology of cooperation and punishment, ecological rationality,\
  \ and psychology of foraging. Dr. Krasnow\u2019s primary line of research focuses\
  \ on the evolutionary origins and computational design of the mechanisms underlying\
  \ human cooperation and social behavior. Why are we more generous, trusting and\
  \ cooperative, but also vengeful and punitive than an otherwise rational analysis\
  \ would predict? He has been exploring how the answers to these questions neatly\
  \ fall out by considering reliable features of the ancestral ecology and simple\
  \ cognitive mechanisms that could evolve to benefit from them.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we talk about different aspects of human sociality. We first discuss how we evolved\
  \ to be so generous, trusting and cooperative. We address the different types of\
  \ natural selection, namely, sexual selection and social selection, and also if\
  \ we need group selection to explain things like strong reciprocity. We then talk\
  \ about uncertainty in human interactions, and why we cooperate in one-shot interactions.\
  \ We refer to the social role of vengeance and punishment; the evolution of honesty;\
  \ the importance of social reputation; and how deterrence works in human societies.</p>\n\
