  \ we talk about family relationships and dynamics from an evolutionary perspective.\
  \ We focus on conflict between couples, the role of jealousy and some mate retention\
  \ tactics, including sperm competition for men. We address how monogamy might have\
  \ evolved. Then, we move on to parent-offspring competition and sibling competition,\
  \ and how the first might potentiate the second. We also talk a bit about religiosity,\
  \ and how it might get transmitted between parents and their children. And we end\
  \ up discussing the possible relationship between kin selection and reciprocal altruism.</p>\n\
