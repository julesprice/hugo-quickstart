shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 11th 2021.  \nEmily Kubin is a PhD student in the\
  \ Political Psychology & Communication Lab at the University of Koblenz-Landau (at\
  \ Landau). She studies political communication. Specifically, she focuses on how\
  \ political opponents view and interact with one another, and the role media play\
  \ in opponents\u2019 perceptions of one another. She places a special focus on studying\
  \ strategies political opponents (and the media) can use to reduce affective polarization.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about affective polarization and the role played by the\
  \ media; where liberals and conservatives differ the most in terms of their political\
  \ attitudes; the role personal experiences and facts play in political disagreements,\
  \ and the situations where personal experiences might elicit respect from political\
  \ opponents; political dehumanization, and interventions to reduce it; and interventions\
  \ to reduce political polarization.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:41  Emily\u2019\
