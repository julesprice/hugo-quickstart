shownotes: "<p>Dr. Jonathan Marks is Professor of Anthropology at the University of\
  \ North Carolina at Charlotte. His primary training is in biological anthropology\
  \ and genetics. In 2006 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for\
  \ the Advancement of Science. In 2012 he was awarded the First Citizen\u2019s Bank\
  \ Scholar\u2019s Medal from UNC Charlotte. In recent years he has been a Visiting\
  \ Research Fellow at the ESRC Genomics Forum in Edinburgh, at the Max Planck Institute\
  \ for the History of Science in Berlin, and a Templeton Fellow at the Institute\
  \ for Advanced Study at Notre Dame. He is a significant figure in anthropology,\
  \ especially on the topic of race. Dr. Marks is skeptical of genetic explanations\
  \ of human behavior, of \"race\" as a biological category, and of science as a rationalistic\
  \ endeavor. He\u2019s the author of books like The Alternative Introduction to Biological\
  \ Anthropology, Tales of the Ex-Apes: How We Think about Human Evolution, and Is\
  \ Science Racist?.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about the ways we think about\
  \ human evolutionary story as an origins story. We refer to the differences between\
  \ a popular origin story and a scientific one. We address hominin species classification,\
  \ and the concepts of ancestry and kinship. We discuss if \u201Crace\u201D is a\
  \ scientifically accurate term, and also the influence of biology and culture in\
  \ human behavior, passing through the notion of \u201Chuman universal\u201D. Finally,\
  \ we discuss if science is inevitably a value-laden enterprise, and the myths behind\
  \ its history.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Marks\u2019 work:</p>\n<p>Faculty page:\
