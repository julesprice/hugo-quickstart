shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 21st, 2020.  \nDr. Michael Taborsky is the Director of\
  \ the Behavioural Ecology Department and Co-director of the Institute of Ecology\
  \ and Evolution at the University of Bern, Switzerland. His major research focus\
  \ is the adaptive function of behavior, with emphasis on cooperation and conflict,\
  \ sociality and sexual reproduction.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about eusociality,\
  \ and how it might tie back to the evolution of organisms, and the division of labor\
  \ between specialized cells. We also discuss the evolution of altruism, and the\
  \ many evolutionary mechanisms behind it, like kin selection, reciprocity, and group\
  \ selection. We focus on generalized reciprocity and unconditional prosociality.\
  \ Then, we move on to talk about sexual reproduction, how it evolved, fixed and\
  \ plastic reproductive strategies, and its relationship with life history phenotypes.\
  \ Finally, we mention the evolution cooperative breeding.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:52\
