  <p>In this episode, we talk about eusociality, and how it might tie back to the\
  \ evolution of organisms, and the division of labor between specialized cells. We\
  \ also discuss the evolution of altruism, and the many evolutionary mechanisms behind\
  \ it, like kin selection, reciprocity, and group selection. We focus on generalized\
  \ reciprocity and unconditional prosociality. Then, we move on to talk about sexual\
  \ reproduction, how it evolved, fixed and plastic reproductive strategies, and its\
  \ relationship with life history phenotypes. Finally, we mention the evolution cooperative\
  \ breeding.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Taborsky\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty\
