shownotes: "<p>Dr. Menelaos Apostolou is currently an Associate Professor at the University\
  \ of Nicosia, Cyprus. He\u2019s the author of a new book, The Evolution of Same-Sex\
  \ Attraction.</p>\n<p>This is my second interview with Dr. Apostolou, where we focus\
  \ on The Evolution of Same-Sex attraction. We start by discussing the evolution\
  \ of sexual reproduction, and we talk a lot about sexual attraction (its evolution;\
  \ if it occurs on a continuum; if it is fluid; and the genetic basis and possible\
  \ environmental factors behind its development, including the fraternal birth order\
  \ effect). We talk about homosexuality in ancient societies, and in hunter-gatherer\
  \ societies. We discuss tolerance and intolerance of same-sex attraction. Dr. Apostolou\
  \ presents his Weak Negative Selection Pressures and Positive Selection Pressures\
  \ Hypotheses for the high prevalence of same-sex attraction in human societies.\
  \ We also talk about why men prefer women who like other women. We discuss a hypothesis\
  \ for why the Catholic Church is intolerant toward same-sex relations. We ask why\
  \ Western societies are tolerant of same-sex attraction, and how it will evolve\
  \ in the future. Finally, we discuss if people can apply this knowledge to develop\
  \ a better understanding of their own sexual attraction and their relationships.</p>\n"
