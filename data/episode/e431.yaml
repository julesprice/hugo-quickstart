shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 19th 2021.  \nDr. Menelaos Apostolou is currently\
  \ an Associate Professor at the University of Nicosia, Cyprus. He was born in Athens,\
  \ Greece and he completed his post-graduate and graduate studies in the United Kingdom.\
  \ He has published several peer-reviewed papers, books and chapters in books in\
  \ the area of evolutionary psychology. He\u2019s the author of a new book, The Evolution\
  \ of Same-Sex Attraction.\n\nThis is my second interview with Dr. Apostolou, where\
  \ we focus on The Evolution of Same-Sex attraction. We start by discussing the evolution\
  \ of sexual reproduction, and we talk a lot about sexual attraction (its evolution;\
  \ if it occurs on a continuum; if it is fluid; and the genetic basis and possible\
  \ environmental factors behind its development, including the fraternal birth order\
  \ effect). We talk about homosexuality in ancient societies, and in hunter-gatherer\
  \ societies. We discuss tolerance and intolerance of same-sex attraction. Dr. Apostolou\
  \ presents his Weak Negative Selection Pressures and Positive Selection Pressures\
  \ Hypotheses for the high prevalence of same-sex attraction in human societies.\
  \ We also talk about why men prefer women who like other women. We discuss a hypothesis\
  \ for why the Catholic Church is intolerant toward same-sex relations. We ask why\
  \ Western societies are tolerant of same-sex attraction, and how it will evolve\
  \ in the future. Finally, we discuss if people can apply this knowledge to develop\
  \ a better understanding of their own sexual attraction and their relationships.\n\
