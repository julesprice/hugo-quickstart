  <p>In this episode, we talk about life history theory, and its application in evolutionary\
  \ psychology. We discuss mating and parenting effort, and sex differences in life\
  \ history strategies. We also talk about the evolved psychology of time perspective.\
  \ We mention how life history theory helps us better understand certain modern health\
  \ issues. And, finally, we talk about postcoital behaviors, and sex differences\
  \ related to them.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Kruger\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty\
