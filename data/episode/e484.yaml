shownotes: "Dr. David F. Bjorklund is a Professor of Psychology at Florida Atlantic\
  \ University where he teaches graduate and undergraduate courses in developmental\
  \ and evolutionary psychology. His books include The Origins of Human Nature: Evolutionary\
  \ Developmental Psychology (with Anthony Pellegrini), Origins of the Social Mind:\
  \ Evolutionary Psychology and Child Development (edited with Bruce Ellis), Why Youth\
  \ is Not Wasted on the Young: Immaturity in Human Development, Child and Adolescent\
  \ Development: An Integrative Approach (with Carlos Hern\xE1ndez Blasi), and Children's\
  \ Thinking: Cognitive Development and Individual Differences, now in its fifth edition.\
  \ His new book is How Children Invented Humanity: The Role of Development in Human\
  \ Evolution.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on How Children Invented Humanity. We\
  \ discuss the relationship between evolution and development. We explore our extended\
  \ period of development, and what distinguishes it from other species. We talk about\
  \ behavioral plasticity, neoteny, behavioral genetics, innateness, and individual\
  \ differences. We discuss play, and its importance for child development. We talk\
  \ about what Piaget got right and what he got wrong, and the issues with thinking\
  \ about development in stages. We ask what the relationship between development\
  \ and the evolution of culture is. We talk about the importance of mothers in our\
  \ evolution. We explore some sex differences in human development, attachment theory,\
  \ and our most distinct social traits. Finally, we discuss some sources of evolutionary\
  \ mismatch in modern societies, like social media, hyper-individualism, and formal\
  \ educational practices, and what we can learn from hunter-gatherers. We also mention\
  \ the negative psychological effects the covid-19 pandemic might be having on children.\n\
