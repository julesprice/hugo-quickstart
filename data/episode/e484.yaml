shownotes: '<p>Dr. David F. Bjorklund is a Professor of Psychology at Florida Atlantic
  University. His new book is How Children Invented Humanity: The Role of Development
  in Human Evolution.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on How Children Invented Humanity. We discuss the relationship
  between evolution and development. We explore our extended period of development,
  and what distinguishes it from other species. We talk about behavioral plasticity,
  neoteny, behavioral genetics, innateness, and individual differences. We discuss
  play, and its importance for child development. We talk about what Piaget got right
  and what he got wrong, and the issues with thinking about development in stages.
  We ask what the relationship between development and the evolution of culture is.
  We talk about the importance of mothers in our evolution. We explore some sex differences
  in human development, attachment theory, and our most distinct social traits. Finally,
  we discuss some sources of evolutionary mismatch in modern societies, like social
  media, hyper-individualism, and formal educational practices, and what we can learn
  from hunter-gatherers. We also mention the negative psychological affects the covid-19
  pandemic might be having on children.</p>
