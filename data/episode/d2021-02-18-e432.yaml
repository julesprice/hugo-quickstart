  \ Predictively Powerful or Riddled with Just-So Stories?. We first tackle the misconception\
  \ of evolutionary psychology\u2019s predictions, hypotheses and theories being nothing\
  \ but just-so stories. We mention hypotheses that have been falsified in evolutionary\
  \ psychology. We discuss the emotions of anger and disgust, and address the controversy\
  \ surrounding the domains of disgust. We talk about error management theory. In\
  \ the final part, we discuss cultural psychology, the influence of culture on human\
  \ psychology, and how evolutionary psychology deals with culture. We also address\
  \ the WEIRD problem in Psychology, and more particularly in evolutionary psychology.</p>\n"
