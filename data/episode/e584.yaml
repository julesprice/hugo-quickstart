shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 25th 2021.  \nDr. William Glod is Senior Program Officer\
  \ at the Institute for Humane Studies, an educational non-profit affiliated with\
  \ George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia. He is the author of Why It\u2019\
  s OK to Make Bad Choices.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Why It\u2019s OK to Make\
  \ Bad Choices. We first discuss how we determine that a particular choice is a bad\
  \ one. We talk about paternalism \u2013 coercive and libertarian. We discuss matters\
  \ related to free will, and State regulations. We talk about the potential life\
  \ benefits of making bad choices, and if people should care about their effects\
  \ on others. We discuss if there are cases where other people should interfere.\
  \ Finally, Dr. Glod tells us if, generally-speaking, it is OK for people to make\
  \ bad choices.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:32  What is a bad choice?  \n\
