shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 28th 2023.  \nDr. Christopher Ferrie is an Associate\
  \ Professor at the University of Technology Sydney and Centre for Quantum Software\
  \ and Information. His research interests include quantum estimation and control,\
  \ and, in particular, the use of machine learning to solve statistical problems\
  \ in quantum information science. He is the author of several books, the latest\
  \ one being Quantum Bullsh*t: How to Ruin Your Life with Advice from Quantum Physics.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on Quantum Bullsh*t. We discuss what \u201Cquantum\u201D\
  \ means, how people misunderstand it, and how pseudoscientists and charlatans distort\
  \ quantum physics. We go through several concepts and phenomena in quantum physics,\
  \ including energy, quantum leap, waves and particles, Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty\
  \ principle, superposition, and quantum entanglement. We discuss if quantum physics\
  \ applies to human psychology, and if it can guide our lives. We also talk about\
  \ time traveling, the multiverse, and quantum computers. Finally, we discuss if\
  \ it is wise to tell people that they should be \u201Cdoing their own research\u201D\
  , if we should \u201Cbelieve\u201D in science, and if trying to debunk absurd claims\
  \ is a waste of time.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:34  What \u201Cquantum\u201D\
