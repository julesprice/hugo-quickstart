shownotes: "<p>Dr. Christopher Ferrie is an Associate Professor at the University\
  \ of Technology Sydney and Centre for Quantum Software and Information. His research\
  \ interests include quantum estimation and control, and, in particular, the use\
  \ of machine learning to solve statistical problems in quantum information science.\
  \ He is the author of several books, the latest one being Quantum Bullsh*t: How\
  \ to Ruin Your Life with Advice from Quantum Physics.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we focus on Quantum Bullsh*t. We discuss what \u201Cquantum\u201D means,\
  \ how people misunderstand it, and how pseudoscientists and charlatans distort quantum\
  \ physics. We go through several concepts and phenomena in quantum physics, including\
  \ energy, quantum leap, waves and particles, Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle,\
  \ superposition, and quantum entanglement. We discuss if quantum physics applies\
  \ to human psychology, and if it can guide our lives. We also talk about time traveling,\
  \ the multiverse, and quantum computers. Finally, we discuss if it is wise to tell\
  \ people that they should be \u201Cdoing their own research\u201D, if we should\
  \ \u201Cbelieve\u201D in science, and if trying to debunk absurd claims is a waste\
  \ of time.</p>\n"
