shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 27th 2022.  \nDr. Martin Lang is an Assistant Professor\
  \ at Masaryk University investigating the evolution of ritual behavior and the relationship\
  \ between anxiety and rituals.\n\nIn this episode, we first talk about synchrony\
  \ in the context of ritual, its psychological effects, identity fusion, how rituals\
  \ might help internalize norms, and the effects of religious music. We then get\
  \ into anxiety, what induces it, and how ritualized behavior helps control it. We\
  \ also talk about the psychological effects of extreme religious practices. We discuss\
  \ the cultural evolution od moralizing gods, and the relationship between religiosity\
  \ and prosociality. Finally, we talk about a complex adaptive systems approach to\
  \ the study of religion.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:30  Synchrony, and\
