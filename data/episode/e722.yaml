  the evolution of ritual behavior and the relationship between anxiety and rituals.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we first talk about synchrony in the context of ritual, its
  psychological effects, identity fusion, how rituals might help internalize norms,
  and the effects of religious music. We then get into anxiety, what induces it, and
  how ritualized behavior helps control it. We also talk about the psychological effects
  of extreme religious practices. We discuss the cultural evolution od moralizing
  gods, and the relationship between religiosity and prosociality. Finally, we talk
  about a complex adaptive systems approach to the study of religion.</p>
