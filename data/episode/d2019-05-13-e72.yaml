  \ He is a professor of biology at the University of New Mexico, and was president\

  \ that give rise to it; why women suffer so much from it, and the possible social\
  \ consequences; what\u2019s wrong with social constructionist theories of rape,\
  \ and why don\u2019t really help the victims of with its prevention; and science-based\
  \ solutions to it.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:40 How evolutionary theory helps\
