shownotes: "<p>Dr. Susan Blackmore is a psychologist, lecturer and writer researching\
  \ consciousness, memes, and anomalous experiences, and a Visiting Professor at the\
  \ University of Plymouth. She is best known for her book The Meme Machine, and has\
  \ written or contributed to over 40 books, mostly on consciousness.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we focus on memetics. First, Dr. Blackmore gives a proper definition\
  \ of memetics, and then we talk about some specific criticisms, some of them coming\
  \ from my interview with Drs. Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson, namely units of culture,\
  \ and memes as viruses. We briefly discuss free will, and then move on to talk about\
  \ imitation as the basis for memetics, and other cognitive mechanisms that an animal\
  \ needs to have to have culture and memes. Toward the end, we also talk about how\
  \ new technologies, like the internet, are changing the way memetics works.</p>\n\
