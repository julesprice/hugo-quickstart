shownotes: "Dr. Susan Blackmore is a psychologist, lecturer and writer researching\
  \ consciousness, memes, and anomalous experiences, and a Visiting Professor at the\
  \ University of Plymouth. She is best known for her book The Meme Machine, and has\
  \ written or contributed to over 40 books, mostly on consciousness.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on memetics. First, Dr. Blackmore gives a proper definition of memetics,\
  \ and then we talk about some specific criticisms, some of them coming from my interviews\
  \ with Drs. Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson, namely units of culture, and memes\
  \ as viruses. We briefly discuss free will, and then move on to talk about imitation\
  \ as the basis for memetics, and other cognitive mechanisms that an animal needs\
  \ to have culture and memes. Toward the end, we also talk about how new technologies,\
  \ like the internet, are changing the way memetics works.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:43\
