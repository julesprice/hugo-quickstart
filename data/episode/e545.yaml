shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 28th 2021.  \nDr. Martin Puchner is the Byron and Anita\
  \ Wien Professor of Drama and of English and Comparative Literature at Harvard University.\
  \ He serves as the founding director of the Mellon School of Theater and Performance\
  \ Research at Harvard University. He is the author of several books, including The\
  \ Language of Thieves: My Family's Obsession with a Secret Code the Nazis Tried\
  \ to Eliminate.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Language of Thieves. We talk\
  \ about the origins of Rotwelsch, how it was influenced by other languages, the\
  \ identity of the people who spoke it, and its social functions. We also discuss\
  \ its relationship with the Nazi regime, and how Rotwelsch-speaking people were\
  \ persecuted by the Nazis. Finally, we talk about what can we learn about a specific\
  \ language by studying the history of its names, and what Rotwelsch can tell us\
  \ about the development and evolution of other languages.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
