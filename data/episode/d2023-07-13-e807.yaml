  of space, politics, and everyday practice. He is the author of Adventure Capitalism:
  A History of Libertarian Exit, from the Era of Decolonization to the Digital Age.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on Adventure Capitalism. We talk about what characterizes
  libertarianism in the US, and how it became popular in the 1960s. We discuss exit
  projects, and how people planned to create new countries in places undergoing decolonization.
  We talk about contemporary Silicon Valley techno-libertarians. We discuss if capitalism
  can really operate without the state. Finally, we talk about how these projects
  might intersect with the history of twentieth-century capitalism.</p>
