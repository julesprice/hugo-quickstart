shownotes: "<p>Dr. Justin Gregg is a Senior Research Associate with the Dolphin Communication\
  \ Project and an Adjunct Professor at St. Francis Xavier University, where he lectures\
  \ on animal behavior and cognition. Originally from Vermont, Dr. Gregg studied the\
  \ echolocation abilities of wild dolphins in Japan and the Bahamas. He is the author\

  <p>In this episode, we focus on If Nietzsche Were a Narwhal. We first talk about\
  \ Nietzsche\u2019s thoughts on other animals. We go through several aspects of animal\
  \ psychology, including intelligence, an understanding of causality, deception and\
  \ lying, an understanding of death and time, norms and morality, consciousness and\
  \ self-awareness, and prognostic myopia, and we talk about some of their drawbacks.\
  \ We ask if there is a relationship between biological complexity and evolutionary\
  \ success. We talk about what is psychologically unique in humans. Finally, we discuss\
  \ if the planet is better off with us, and the goal of the book.</p>\n"
