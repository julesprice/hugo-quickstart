  \ and he is also the President of the European Philosophy of Science Association.\
  \ He has broad philosophical interests, though most of his research falls into two\
  \ main areas: (i) philosophy of biology / evolutionary theory; and (ii) epistemology\
  \ /philosophy of science. Within philosophy of biology, he is especially interested\

  \ many years, his research focused on the 'levels of selection' question in evolutionary\
  \ biology, and the related issue of individual versus group conflicts of interest.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, the main focus of our conversation is on philosophy of biology,\
  \ and the levels of selection in evolutionary theory. We first discuss the several\
  \ ways to think about levels of selection. We talk about the issue with group selection,\
  \ the evolution of altruism, and multi-level selection theory. We also refer to\
  \ the gene\u2019s-eye view, and what it is about. We discuss the extended evolutionary\
  \ synthesis, and non-genetic inheritance mechanisms like cultural evolution and\
  \ epigenetics. Toward the end, we also briefly talk about the usefulness (or lack\
  \ thereof) of a species-level selection perspective.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow\
