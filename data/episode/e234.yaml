shownotes: "Dr. Samir Okasha is a Professor of Philosophy of Science at the University\
  \ of Bristol. He is a winner of the Lakatos Award for his book Evolution and the\
  \ Levels of Selection. He was appointed a Fellow of the British Academy in 2018,\
  \ and he is also the President of the European Philosophy of Science Association.\
  \ He has broad philosophical interests, though most of his research falls into two\
  \ main areas: (i) philosophy of biology / evolutionary theory; and (ii) epistemology\
  \ /philosophy of science. Within philosophy of biology, he is especially interested\
  \ in foundational and conceptual questions surrounding evolutionary theory. For\
  \ many years, his research focused on the 'levels of selection' question in evolutionary\
  \ biology, and the related issue of individual versus group conflicts of interest.\n\
  \nIn this episode, the main focus of our conversation is on philosophy of biology,\
  \ and the levels of selection in evolutionary theory. We first discuss the several\
  \ ways to think about levels of selection. We talk about the issue with group selection,\
  \ the evolution of altruism, and multi-level selection theory. We also refer to\
  \ the gene\u2019s-eye view, and what it is about. We discuss the extended evolutionary\
  \ synthesis, and non-genetic inheritance mechanisms like cultural evolution and\
  \ epigenetics. Toward the end, we also briefly talk about the usefulness (or lack\
  \ thereof) of a species-level selection perspective. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:13  What\
