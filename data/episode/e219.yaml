  \nIn this episode, we talk about Cultural Anthropology. Dr. Cronk starts first gives\
  \ us a brief account of the history of the field, and then we discuss how to think\
  \ about the relationship between biology and culture. We then get into more specific\
  \ subjects of Dr. Cronk\u2019s work, including the importance of separating behavior\
  \ from culture, the mismatch between what people say and what they do, and why that\
  \ happens. We also talk about human cooperation and the phenomenon of fitness interdependence,\
  \ and a bit about the many layers and issues of cultural group selection.\n\nTime\
