shownotes: "<p>Dr. Colin Allen is Distinguished Professor, and Director of Graduate\
  \ Admissions in the Department of History and Philosophy of at the University of\
  \ Pittsburgh. Dr. Allen's main areas of research concern the philosophical foundations\

  <p>In this episode, we explore some topics of the cognitive sciences and philosophy\
  \ of mind. We start by discussing what is a mind, how minds evolved, and our wrong\
  \ intuitions about minds. We then address the topic of cognition, and what it is\
  \ about, and talk about cognitive ethology. We also discuss issues surrounding the\
  \ massive modularity of mind proposal. We get into the role of philosophy in the\
  \ modern intellectual environment. Finally, we talk about what is cognitively special\
  \ about humans, and animal ethics.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Allen\u2019s work:</p>\n\
