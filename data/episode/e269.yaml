shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 3rd, 2019.  \nDr. Colin Allen is Distinguished Professor,\
  \ and Director of Graduate Admissions in the Department of History and Philosophy\
  \ of Science at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Allen's main areas of research\
  \ concern the philosophical foundations of cognitive science and neuroscience. He\
  \ is particularly interested in the scientific study of cognition in nonhuman animals\
  \ and computers, and he has published widely on topics in the philosophy of mind,\
  \ philosophy of biology, and artificial intelligence.\n\nIn this episode, we explore\
  \ some topics of the cognitive sciences and philosophy of mind. We start by discussing\
  \ what is a mind, how minds evolved, and our wrong intuitions about minds. We then\
  \ address the topic of cognition, and what it is about, and talk about cognitive\
  \ ethology. We also discuss issues surrounding the massive modularity of mind proposal.\
  \ We get into the role of philosophy in the modern intellectual environment. Finally,\
  \ we talk about what is cognitively special about humans, and animal ethics.\n\n\
