  <p>In this episode, we talk about the psychology of incels, and modern mating. We
  first define incels, and go through their psychological traits. We talk about their
  mental wellbeing, and their self-perceptions of their own mate value. We discuss
  possible psychotherapeutic approaches, and singlehood. We talk about how people
  should view incels, misrepresentations in the media, and the advice they get online.
  We then get into some issues with modern mating, how it is hard for both men and
  women, and potential solutions.</p>
