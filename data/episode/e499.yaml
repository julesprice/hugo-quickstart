shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 13th 2021.  \nDr. Nicolas Bommarito is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Philosophy at Simon Fraser University. His research focuses on questions in\
  \ virtue ethics, moral psychology, and Buddhist philosophy, particularly Tibetan\
  \ Buddhism. He is the author of Seeing Clearly: A Buddhist Guide to Life.\n\nIn\
  \ this episode, we focus on Seeing Clearly. We start with some of the theoretical\
  \ foundations of Buddhism, and cover concepts like emptiness, the relational nature\
  \ of reality, the self, and attachment. We talk about personal transformation and\
  \ the more existential aspects of Buddhism, including the concept of potential,\
  \ death, goals in life, morality, karma, and nirvana. We also talk about Buddhism\
  \ in the West, and things like mindfulness. Finally, we discuss the practice of\
  \ Buddhism, and ask where people who are interested in becoming Buddhists should\
  \ start from. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:34  The philosophy of Buddhism\
