  \ in Political Psychology at the University of Birmingham, Director of the Institute\
  \ for Conflict Cooperation and Security, Director for the MSc in Political Psychology\
  \ of International Relations, and President of the International Society of Political\

  \ determinants of political judgments. She is particularly interested in the role\
  \ of emotions and values on political radicalization and tolerance, the formation\
  \ and updating of institutional and individual reputations and the role of trust\
  \ and confidence on political accountability attributions.\n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ talk about issues in political psychology. We first go into the affective, cognitive,\
  \ and motivational determinants of political judgment. We talk about political radicalization.\
  \ We discuss where political values stem from, and how we go from values to ideology.\
  \ We talk about the psychology of political tolerance. We get into reactionary politics,\
  \ and ressentiment. Finally, we discuss progressivism and conservatism.\n\nTime\
