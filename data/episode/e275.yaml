shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 17th, 2019.  \nDr. Marco Del Giudice is Associate\
  \ Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of New Mexico. In\
  \ his work he explores a wide range of topics at the intersection of human behavior,\
  \ evolution, and development. His approach is interdisciplinary and driven by the\
  \ quest for theoretical synthesis. Over the years he has developed some broad, integrative\
  \ models: the Adaptive Calibration Model of individual differences in stress responsivity\
  \ (with Bruce Ellis and Birdie Shirtcliff); an evolutionary-developmental model\
  \ of sex differences in attachment styles; and a unifying life history framework\
  \ for evolutionary psychopathology. Most of his current empirical work is devoted\
  \ to testing, advancing, and refining these models with a variety of research methods.\
  \ He\u2019s the author of Evolutionary Psychopathology: A Unified Approach.\n\n\
  In this episode, we go through the main topics of Dr. Del Giudice\u2019s book, Evolutionary\
  \ Psychopathology. He explains what the field is about, and how its approach differs\
  \ from more traditional/mainstream ones in psychiatry and clinical psychology. Then\
  \ we get into topics related to human development, like the canalization of developmental\
  \ processes, motivational systems, and attachment styles. We also talk about behavioral\
  \ genetics and differential susceptibility. Dr. Del Giudice explains the central\
  \ approach to a new system of classification for mental disorders that he exposes\
  \ in the book, the fast-slow-defense model (FSD). Toward the end, we also discuss\
  \ the several different difficulties in classifying mental disorders.\n\nTime Links:\
