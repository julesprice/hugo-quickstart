shownotes: "<p>Dr. Iddo Landau is a Professor of Philosophy at the University of Haifa.\
  \ He has written extensively on the meaning of life. He is the author of Finding\
  \ Meaning in an Imperfect World.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Finding Meaning\
  \ in an Imperfect World. We start by discussing what is meaning, and how we decide\
  \ that a life is meaningful of meaningless. We go through different criteria to\
  \ determine the meaningfulness of life: the perfectionist view of life; the importance\
  \ of freedom; if life has to be moral; if an unexamined life is worth living; if\
  \ life has to be planned or have goals; if people need a purpose; suffering; antinatalism,\
  \ and Benatar\u2019s perspective; good and bad experiences, and how they weigh on\
  \ the balance of meaning; our insignificance from the point of view of the Universe;\
  \ death; suicide; and religion and systems of value. We also talk about the meaningfulness\
  \ of lives of other animals, and their moral status. Finally, we discuss potential\
  \ arguments that could convince desperate people that they lives are meaningful.</p>\n"
