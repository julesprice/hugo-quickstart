shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 16th 2022.  \nDr. Branko Milanovi\u0107 is Presidential\
  \ Professor at the Graduate Center and a senior fellow at the Stone Center on Socio-Economic\
  \ Inequality at The City University of New York (CUNY). Dr. Milanovi\u0107\u2019\
  s main area of work is income inequality, in individual countries and globally,\
  \ as well as historically, among pre-industrial societies (Roman Empire, Byzantium,\
  \ and France before the Revolution), and even inequality in soccer. His books include\
  \ \u201CThe Haves and the Have-nots: A Brief and Idiosyncratic History of Global\
  \ Inequality\u201D, \u201CGlobal Inequality: A New Approach for the Age of Globalization\u201D\
  , and \u201CCapitalism, Alone\u201D.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on \u201CCapitalism,\
  \ Alone\u201D. We start by defining capitalism, and distinguishing mainly between\
  \ political capitalism and liberal meritocratic capitalism. We talk about China\u2019\
  s political capitalism, and the historical role of communism. We get into economic\
  \ inequality, and discuss how it is measured, recent trends, what drives it, if\
  \ it is a problem, and how to reduce it. We discuss specifically Universal Basic\
  \ Income as a proposed solution. Finally, we ask if capitalism has been a net-positive\
  \ for global society, and if it is possible to predict its future.\n\nTime Links:\
