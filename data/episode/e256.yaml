shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 6th, 2019.  \nDr. Catherine Salmon is a Full Professor\
  \ in the psychology department at the University of Redlands. She is the co-author\
  \ (with Donald Symons) of Warrior Lovers: Erotic fiction, evolution and female sexuality.\
  \ She has written chapters in numerous books including Buss' Handbook of Evolutionary\
  \ Psychology and The Literary Animal. She is also a co-editor of the books Evolutionary\
  \ Psychology: Public Policy and Personal Decisions (with Charles Crawford) Family\
  \ Psychology: An Evolutionary Perspective and the Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary\
  \ Family Psychology (both with Todd Shackelford), and co-author with Katrin Schuman\
  \ of The Secret Power of Middle Children. Her primary research interests include\
  \ birth order and the family, reproductive suppression and dieting behavior, and\
  \ female sexuality, particularly with regard to prostitution and pornography. Her\
  \ interest in pop culture also led to co-authoring a chapter on female wrestling\
  \ fans and their fantasies in Steel Chair to the Head: The Pleasure and Pain of\
  \ Professional Wrestling.\n\nIn this episode, we cover several different topics\
  \ of Dr. Salmon\u2019s work. We first talk about birth order, parental investment\
  \ and sibling conflict, and also how there might be parent-offspring conflict over\
  \ mates. We also refer to evolutionary approaches to dieting behavior and anorexia\
  \ in women. And then we get into topics of popular culture and consumer behavior,\
  \ like pornography, romance novels, and slash fiction. Near the end, Dr. Salmon\
  \ tells us about her upcoming book, co-authored with Barry Kuhle, On the Origin\
  \ of the Evolution Revolution: Conversations with the Pioneers of Evolutionary Biology,\
  \ Anthropology, and Psychology.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:39  Birth order and sibling\
