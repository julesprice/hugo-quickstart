shownotes: "<p>RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 6th, 2019.</p>\n<p>Dr. Catherine Salmon is a\
  \ Full Professor in the psychology department at the University of Redlands. She\
  \ is the co-author (with Donald Symons) of Warrior Lovers: Erotic fiction, evolution\
  \ and female sexuality. She has written chapters in numerous books including Buss'\
  \ Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology and The Literary Animal. She is also a co-editor\
  \ of the books Evolutionary Psychology: Public Policy and Personal Decisions (with\
  \ Charles Crawford) Family Psychology: An Evolutionary Perspective and the Oxford\
  \ Handbook of Evolutionary Family Psychology (both with Todd Shackelford), and co-author\
  \ with Katrin Schuman of The Secret Power of Middle Children. Her primary research\
  \ interests include birth order and the family, reproductive suppression and dieting\
  \ behavior, and female sexuality, particularly with regard to prostitution and pornography.\
  \ Her interest in pop culture also led to co-authoring a chapter on female wrestling\
  \ fans and their fantasies in Steel Chair to the Head: The Pleasure and Pain of\
  \ Professional Wrestling.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we cover several different topics\
  \ of Dr. Salmon\u2019s work. We first talk about birth order, parental investment\
  \ and sibling conflict, and also how there might be parent-offspring conflict over\
  \ mates. We also refer to evolutionary approaches to dieting behavior and anorexia\
  \ in women. And then we get into topics of popular culture and consumer behavior,\
  \ like pornography, romance novels, and slash fiction. Near the end, Dr. Salmon\
  \ tells us about her upcoming book, co-authored with Barry Kuhle, On the Origin\
  \ of the Evolution Revolution: Conversations with the Pioneers of Evolutionary Biology,\
  \ Anthropology, and Psychology.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Salmon\u2019s work:</p>\n\
