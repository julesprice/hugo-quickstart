shownotes: "Dr. Sarah Brosnan is a Professor in the departments of psychology and\
  \ philosophy and the Neuroscience Institute at Georgia State University. She is\
  \ also a member of the Brains & Behavior program and the Center for Behavioral Neuroscience.\
  \ She directs the Comparative Economics and Behavioral Studies Laboratory (CEBUS\
  \ Lab) and does research with nonhuman primates at both the Language Research Center\
  \ of Georgia State University and the Michale E. Keeling Center for Comparative\
  \ Medicine and Research of the University of Texas Anderson Cancer Center. She studies\
  \ the mechanisms underlying cooperation, reciprocity, inequity, and other economic\
  \ decisions in nonhuman primates from an evolutionary perspective. She looks at\
  \ the decisions individuals make and how they make them, how their social or ecological\
  \ environments affect their decisions and interactions, and under what circumstances\
  \ they can alter their behaviors depending on these conditions.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about biology, comparative psychology, and moral behavior. First, Dr.\
  \ Brosnan tells us about the primates that she studies the most and the sorts of\
  \ behaviors she\u2019s most interested in. Then, we discuss how to properly do comparative\
  \ psychology, and compare the behavior of humans to other species, particularly\
  \ primates. We also talk about what is morality from a biological perspective and\
  \ its functions. And very important to understand morality are the processes of\
  \ kin selection, reciprocal altruism, and the contentious topic of group selection.\
  \ After that, we talk about some specific moral behaviors, like inequity aversion\
  \ and the sense of fairness, and the endowment effect and the sense of property,\
  \ in nonhuman primates. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:55  The primates Dr. Brosnan studies,\
