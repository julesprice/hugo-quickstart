shownotes: "<p>Dr. Nichola Raihani is Professor of Evolution and Behavior at University\
  \ College London. Her research considers the evolution of cooperation in nature.\
  \ She was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology in 2019. Her first book\
  \ is The Social Instinct: How Cooperation Shaped the World.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we focus on The Social Instinct. We first discuss the structure of the book, and\
  \ why the focus is on cooperation. We talk about the mechanisms used to explain\
  \ the evolution of cooperation \u2013 kin selection, reciprocal altruism, and group\
  \ selection. We then get into what a family is from a evolutionary perspective,\
  \ and discuss the role of mothers and fathers, and cooperative breeding. We question\
  \ the model of the nuclear family, and also talk about grandmothers. We ask why\
  \ men live so long. We discuss why people help unrelated others, and why we are\
  \ so uncharitable to those doing good deeds. We ask if we are ultimately selfish.\
  \ Other topics include: interdependence; why we care so much about what other people\
  \ think of us; social comparison; and the ability to join together and rebel against\
  \ tyrannical leaders. We wrap up with discussing how we can promote large-scale\
  \ cooperation.</p>\n"
