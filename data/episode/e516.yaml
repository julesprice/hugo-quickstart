shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 10th 2021.  \nDr. Nichola Raihani is Professor of Evolution\
  \ and Behavior at University College London. Her research considers the evolution\
  \ of cooperation in nature. She was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology\
  \ in 2019. Her first book is The Social Instinct: How Cooperation Shaped the World.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on The Social Instinct. We first discuss the structure\
  \ of the book, and why the focus is on cooperation. We talk about the mechanisms\
  \ used to explain the evolution of cooperation \u2013 kin selection, reciprocal\
  \ altruism, and group selection. We then get into what a family is from a evolutionary\
  \ perspective, and discuss the role of mothers and fathers, and cooperative breeding.\
  \ We question the model of the nuclear family, and also talk about grandmothers.\
  \ We ask why men live so long. We discuss why people help unrelated others, and\
  \ why we are so uncharitable to those doing good deeds. We ask if we are ultimately\
  \ selfish. Other topics include: interdependence; why we care so much about what\
  \ other people think of us; social comparison; and the ability to join together\
  \ and rebel against tyrannical leaders. We wrap up with discussing how we can promote\
  \ large-scale cooperation.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:37  The premise\
