  \ Center and a senior fellow at the Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality at\
  \ The City University of New York (CUNY). Dr. Milanovi\u0107\u2019s main area of\
  \ work is income inequality, in individual countries and globally, as well as historically,\
  \ among pre-industrial societies (Roman Empire, Byzantium, and France before the\
  \ Revolution), and even inequality in soccer. His latest book is Visions of Inequality:\
  \ From the French Revolution to the End of the Cold War.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we focus on Visions of Inequality. We start by talking about how long\
  \ people have been thinking about economic inequality, and the elements of the best\
  \ income distribution studies. We then go through the work of authors like Fran\xE7\
  ois Quesnay, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, Vilfredo Pareto, and Simon Kuznets,\
  \ and how there was a natural progression across them. We discuss how and why studies\
  \ of income distribution went into retreat during the Cold War era; the rise of\
  \ neoliberalism and its consequences; and what led to the revival of economic studies.\
  \ We also talk about a recent expansion in our understanding of the dynamics of\
  \ inequality, with race and gender inequality. Finally, we discuss Dr. Milanovi\u0107\
  \u2019s goals with this book.</p>\n"
