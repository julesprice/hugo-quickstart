shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 30th 2023.  \nDr. Paul Russell is Professor of Philosophy\
  \ at Lund University (half-time appointment since 2018). He also serves as Director\
  \ of the Lund|Gothenburg Responsibility Project (LGRP). Dr. Russell's interests\
  \ cover the areas of free will and moral responsibility along with various topics\
  \ in early modern philosophy. Within the area of free will and moral responsibility\
  \ he is particularly interested in the challenge of skepticism and theories of responsibility\
  \ that appeal to reactive attitudes or moral sentiments. On the subject of early\
  \ modern philosophy, he is especially concerned with the philosophy of David Hume\
  \ and how his philosophy relates to problems of religion and atheism.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about free will and moral responsibility. We start by talking\
  \ about how to approach free will from the perspective of Philosophy, and we discuss\
  \ the necessary conditions for its existence. We talk about the relationship between\
  \ free will and moral responsibility. We address the challenge of skepticism. We\
  \ discuss moral sentiments, and how they connect to questions of moral responsibility.\
  \ Finally, we talk about reactive attitudes, blame, punishment, and retribution;\
  \ and how people who do wrong can be morally motivated.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
