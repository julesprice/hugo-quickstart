shownotes: '<p>Dr. Paul Russell is Professor of Philosophy at Lund University (half-time
  appointment since 2018). He also serves as Director of the Lund|Gothenburg Responsibility
  Project (LGRP). Dr. Russell&#39;s interests cover the areas of free will and moral
  responsibility along with various topics in early modern philosophy. Within the
  area of free will and moral responsibility he is particularly interested in the
  challenge of skepticism and theories of responsibility that appeal to reactive attitudes
  or moral sentiments.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about free will and moral responsibility. We start by
  talking about how to approach free will from the perspective of Philosophy, and
  we discuss the necessary conditions for its existence. We talk about the relationship
  between free will and moral responsibility. We address the challenge of skepticism.
  We discuss moral sentiments, and how they connect to questions of moral responsibility.
  Finally, we talk about reactive attitudes, blame, punishment, and retribution; and
  how people who do wrong can be morally motivated.</p>
