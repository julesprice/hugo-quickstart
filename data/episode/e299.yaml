  <p>In this episode, we talk about language and communication. We start with communication\
  \ from a biological perspective, and then establish a bridge with language, and\
  \ talk about its evolutionary foundations and the cognitive mechanisms associated\
  \ with it. We also refer to the cognitive and anatomical tools that an organism\
  \ needs to produce language. We also address the cultural evolution of languages,\
  \ and discuss cultural attraction theory and the study of language in the lab. We\
  \ go through some social aspects of language, referring to Michael Tomasello\u2019\
  s concept of shared intentionality, and phenomena like epistemic vigilance and the\
  \ argumentative theory of reasoning. Finally, we talk about meaning.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
