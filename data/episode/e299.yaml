shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 11th, 2019.  \nDr. Thomas Scott-Phillips is a Senior\
  \ Research Scientist in the Social Mind Center and the Department of Cognitive Science,\
  \ at Central European University, Budapest. In particular he studies communication,\
  \ and how it makes us human. His first book, Speaking Our Minds, was reviewed as\
  \ \u201CThe most important and the best book ever written on the evolution of language\u201D\
  \ and \u201CThe best linguistics book I\u2019ve read in 10 years\u201D. He\u2019\
  s written short pieces for outlets such as Aeon, Scientific American, The Conversation;\
  \ and he has given public talks for TEDx, British Humanist Association, Skeptics\
  \ In The Pub, Digital Science and others. His academic articles and broader interests\
  \ span cultural evolution, primate communication, language acquisition, philosophy\
  \ of language, and others.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about language and communication.\
  \ We start with communication from a biological perspective, and then establish\
  \ a bridge with language, and talk about its evolutionary foundations and the cognitive\
  \ mechanisms associated with it. We also refer to the cognitive and anatomical tools\
  \ that an organism needs to produce language. We also address the cultural evolution\
  \ of languages, and discuss cultural attraction theory and the study of language\
  \ in the lab. We go through some social aspects of language, referring to Michael\
  \ Tomasello\u2019s concept of shared intentionality, and phenomena like epistemic\
  \ vigilance and the argumentative theory of reasoning. Finally, we talk about meaning.\n\
