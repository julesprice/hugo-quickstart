shownotes: "<p>Dr. Justin L. Barrett is adjunct professor of psychology at Fuller\
  \ Theological Seminary. His new book is Thriving with Stone Age Minds: Evolutionary\
  \ Psychology, Christian Faith, and the Quest for Human Flourishing.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we focus on Thriving with Stone Age Minds. We start by defining \u201C\
  thriving\u201D, and what it means from both an evolutionary psychological and a\
  \ Christian theological perspective. We discuss why the book is focused on Christianity\
  \ and not any other religion. We talk about the concept of \u201Chuman nature\u201D\
  . We talk about the concepts/phenomena of niche construction, evolutionary mismatch,\
  \ and the nature-niche gap. We discuss the interplay between evolutionary psychology\
  \ and Christian theology in human flourishing. We talk about the traits of self-control,\
  \ hypersociality, and expertise acquisition. We then talk about cases of evolutionary\
  \ mismatch in modern industrialized societies, like the education system, professional\
  \ occupations, and self-control. We also discuss the religious concept of \u201C\
  telos\u201D. Finally, we discuss potential conflicts that might arise between a\
  \ scientific and a Christian understanding of the world.</p>\n"
