shownotes: "Dr. Jon Wisman is Professor of Economics at American University in Washington,\
  \ DC. He teaches graduate courses in the history of economic thought and economic\
  \ methodology and undergraduate courses in macroeconomics, European economic history,\
  \ American economic history, economic development, and labor economics. He is the\
  \ author of The Origins and Dynamics of Inequality: Sex, Politics, and Ideology.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on The Origins and Dynamics of Inequality. We first\
  \ talk about the different kinds of inequality addressed in the book. We discuss\
  \ the account of inequality presented in the book, and how it differs from the ones\
  \ put forth by other economists. We get into the evolutionary bases of inequality,\
  \ focusing on sexual selection, and the relationship between mating systems and\
  \ inequality. We walk through inequality in forager societies, the early agricultural\
  \ states, and European feudalism. We talk about ideology, legitimation theory, and\
  \ the role of religion. We discuss the advent of Protestantism, and the rise of\
  \ a new ideology. We talk about how workers gained formal political power starting\
  \ in the 19th century. We go through the Great Depression and a decline in inequality\
  \ between the 1930s and the 1970s; and the political and economic changes in the\
  \ 70s, and the levels of inequality we see today. Finally, we discuss the future\
  \ of inequality, and possible solutions.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:33\
