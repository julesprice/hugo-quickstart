shownotes: "<p>Dr. Jonathon Crystal is Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences\
  \ at Indiana University. His research focuses on developing animal models of cognition.\
  \ His current work focuses on episodic memory, source memory, and prospective memory\
  \ in rats. He has also developed rodent models to assess retrieval practice, working\
  \ memory, and metacognition. He is currently the Editor of Learning &amp; Behavior,\
  \ and he recently served as President of the Comparative Cognition Society.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about studying memory in nonhuman animals, primarily\
  \ in rats. First, we talk about ways of classifying different types of memory. We\
  \ then get into how Dr. Crystal designs experiments to study different types of\
  \ memory and know if they even exist in other animals, including episodic memory\
  \ and prospective memory. Toward the end, we also refer to metacognition.</p>\n\
