shownotes: '<p>Dr. Alessandra Cassar is a Professor of Economics at the University
  of San Francisco. She is the Vice-President for North America of the Economic Science
  Association. Her current research concentrates on the under-studied areas of female
  competitiveness; the consequences of conflict and disaster victimization for altruism,
  trust, religiosity, risk, and time preferences; and the role of social networks
  for economic outcomes.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we start by talking about female competitiveness and what motivates
  it; sex differences in competitiveness, and their effects in the workplace and the
  job market. We discuss the evolution of prosociality anchored to human cooperative
  breeding. We discuss how civil conflict affects trust and market development, and
  the effects of natural disasters on altruism. We get into how microfinancing works,
  and how social capital applies to it; the role of goals, incentives, and support
  groups in the success of microentrepreneurs; and what financial exclusion is. Finally,
  we talk about networked markets.</p>
