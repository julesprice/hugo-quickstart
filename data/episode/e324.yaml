  \ are intertwined in the high-end coffee market.\n\nIn this episode, we focus mostly\
  \ on the anthropology of wellbeing, also known as positive anthropology, as developed\
  \ by Dr. Fischer. Before tackling the topic, we talk about the different branches\
  \ of anthropology in the US. We then get into questions regarding the good life,\
  \ values, stated and revealed preferences, and meta-preferences. We also mention\
  \ how the market allows for the expression of values. Finally, we talk about Dr.\

  \ ways they connect with coffee production.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n01:41  The different\
