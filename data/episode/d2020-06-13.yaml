shownotes: "<p>I feel very humbled and grateful from the bottom of my heart to you\
  \ all!</p>\n<p>But I am still going through hard times.</p>\n<p>In order to sustain\
  \ the channel, and even to support myself I need your help.</p>\n<p>I am trying\
  \ to get another job to complement what I am getting from the channel, but you certainly\
  \ now that that is extremely difficult at the moment, due to the impact coronavirus\
  \ is having on the economy across the globe.</p>\n<p>I am going to try my very best,\
  \ but I am desperate. If you appreciate what I am doing, and have some money you\
  \ could spare, please help me!</p>\n<p>For these past two years and four months,\
  \ I have brought on the show some of the top academics/scholars in a diversity of\
  \ fields, like Psychology, Anthropology, Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, Philosophy,\
  \ and even Literary Studies.</p>\n<p>On my show, you can certainly find informative,\
  \ well-researched, engaging, and fun interviews on topics that will feed your intellectual\
  \ interest.</p>\n<p>My income for these past two years has depended completely on\
  \ the donations made by my charitable patrons and Paypal supporters, but, unfortunately,\
  \ it is not enough.</p>\n<p>In today\u2019s society, scientific literacy is ever\
  \ more important, and, hopefully, I have been contributing to spread knowledge outside\
  \ of academia in a format that I try my best to be accessible even to laypeople.</p>\n\
  <p>So I ask you to please consider supporting me on the platforms I link here. I\
  \ am leaving a link to my Patreon page and links to monthly subscriptions on Paypal,\
  \ and also a link to Paypal for a one-time big donation, if you prefer, if any of\
  \ you would be generous enough to become a patron or give me a one-time big donation.</p>\n\
