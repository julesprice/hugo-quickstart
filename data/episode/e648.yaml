shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 12th 2022.  \nDr. Niamh McLoughlin is a Lecturer in\
  \ Developmental Psychology at University of Kent. She studies how social information\
  \ impacts young children\u2019s cognition, evaluations and behavior.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about children\u2019s social cognition. We first discuss how\
  \ early children start processing social information, and then go through topics\
  \ like religiosity and religious beliefs; believing in the content of stories; inferring\
  \ causal relations; mental state talk, and theory of mind; the development of group\
  \ affiliations; dehumanization; and interventions to promote prosocial behavior\
  \ toward out-group members.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:27  How early do\
