  <p>In this episode, we talk about the evolution of human bipedality. We start by
  talking about the locomotion of our common ancestor with chimpanzees, and go through
  some of the main steps in the evolution of our musculoskeletal system. During the
  conversation, Dr. Crompton shows some fossils to the camera. We discuss if we can
  learn something about the evolution of our locomotion by studying the environments
  we evolved in, and also our diet. We talk about some of the hypotheses relating
  to the evolutionary pressures behind our bipedalism. Finally, we talk about modern
  musculoskeletal diseases.</p>
