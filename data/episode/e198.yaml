shownotes: "<p>Dr. Stephen K. Sanderson is an American sociologist. He was a professor\
  \ of sociology at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Since 2007 he has been a visiting\
  \ scholar at the Institute for Research on World-Systems at the University of California,\
  \ Riverside. His areas of focus include comparative sociology, historical sociology,\
  \ sociological theory and sociocultural evolution. He is a specialist in sociological\
  \ theory and comparative and historical sociology and is one of the leading sociologists\
  \ to develop a Darwinian understanding of human society. He has written or edited\
  \ ten books, including \u201CThe Evolution of Human Sociality: A Darwinian Conflict\
  \ Perspective\u201D, \u201CEvolutionism and Its Critics\u201D, \u201CHuman Nature\
  \ and the Evolution of Society\u201D, and \u201CReligious Evolution and the Axial\
  \ Age\u201D.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we cover a lot of ground in Sociology and\
  \ the Social Sciences. We start by talking about traditional approaches to sociology,\
  \ the limitations of sociocultural accounts of human behavior, the importance of\
  \ fields like sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, and the criteria to determine\
  \ that a behavioral trait has a biological basis. We also discuss how to think about\
  \ culture, and the relationship between culture and biology, and then Dr. Sanderson\
  \ gives an overview of his Darwinian conflict theory, that tries to integrate evolutionary\
  \ theory with Weberian conflict theory (with bits of Marx in there). Finally, we\
  \ talk about Dr. Sanderson\u2019s work on religion, and three different types of\
  \ religion \u2013 shamanic, polytheistic (pagan), and monotheistic (world transcendent).</p>\n\
