shownotes: "Dr. Stephen K. Sanderson is an American sociologist. He was a professor\
  \ of sociology at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Since 2007 he has been a visiting\
  \ scholar at the Institute for Research on World-Systems at the University of California,\
  \ Riverside. His areas of focus include comparative sociology, historical sociology,\
  \ sociological theory and sociocultural evolution. He is a specialist in sociological\
  \ theory and comparative and historical sociology and is one of the leading sociologists\
  \ to develop a Darwinian understanding of human society. He has written or edited\
  \ ten books, including \u201CThe Evolution of Human Sociality: A Darwinian Conflict\
  \ Perspective\u201D, \u201CEvolutionism and Its Critics\u201D, \u201CHuman Nature\
  \ and the Evolution of Society\u201D, and \u201CReligious Evolution and the Axial\
  \ Age\u201D.\n\nIn this episode, we cover a lot of ground in Sociology and the Social\
  \ Sciences. We start by talking about traditional approaches to sociology, the limitations\
  \ of sociocultural accounts of human behavior, the importance of fields like sociobiology\
  \ and evolutionary psychology, and the criteria to determine that a behavioral trait\
  \ has a biological basis. We also discuss how to think about culture, and the relationship\
  \ between culture and biology, and then Dr. Sanderson gives an overview of his Darwinian\
  \ conflict theory, that tries to integrate evolutionary theory with Weberian conflict\
  \ theory (with bits of Marx in there). Finally, we talk about Dr. Sanderson\u2019\
  s work on religion, and three different types of religion \u2013 shamanic, polytheistic\
  \ (pagan), and monotheistic (world transcendent).\n\nTime Links:  \n01:47  Problems\

  \ and others), and the Standard Social Science Model  \n20:40  Early 19th century\

  \ of Boas and Mead                                                \n32:18  How to\
  \ properly think about cultural variation, and the modularity of mind approach \
  \                                              \n39:52  Criteria to determine that\

  \        \n45:13  We would also need biology to explain environmental determinism\
  \  \n49:12  What is culture really about? And the biological bases of culture  \
