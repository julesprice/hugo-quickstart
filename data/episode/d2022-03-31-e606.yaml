shownotes: "<p>Dr. Peter Sterling is Professor of Neuroscience in the Perelman School\
  \ of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. His broad goal has been to learn\
  \ how the brain is designed \u2013 to understand its functional architecture. He\
  \ is the author of books like Principles of Neural Design, and What is health? Allostasis\
  \ and the Evolution of Human Design.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on What is\
  \ health?. We start by talking about the best way to approach the study of how the\
  \ brain is designed, and how to study it at different scales. We discuss the concept\
  \ of \u201Callostasis\u201D. We talk about four epochs that characterize the design\
  \ of the human brain. We discuss the concept of \u201Coptimality\u201D in design.\
  \ We talk about an explanation for things like music, art, play, comedy, and laughter.\
  \ Finally, we get a bit into questions surrounding modern medicine, like how to\
  \ distinguish between a disorder and expected variation, and the problem with the\
  \ principle of homeostasis.</p>\n"
