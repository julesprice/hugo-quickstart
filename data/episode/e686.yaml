shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 25th 2022.  \nDr. Olivier Morin has a full-time tenured\
  \ research position at the Institut Jean Nicod in Paris. He is also a Research group\
  \ leader at the Max Planck Institute for Geoanthropology in Jena, with the Minds\
  \ and Traditions Research Group. His work focuses on cultural transmission and touches\
  \ on the relations between anthropology, psychology and the philosophy of social\
  \ science. He is the author of How Traditions Live and Die.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on How Traditions Live and Die. We first define \u201Ctradition\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cculture\u201D. We talk about theories of cultural transmission, like\
  \ memetics, and forms of cultural transmission, like imitation, learning, communication,\
  \ teaching, and social influence. We discuss the Theory of Diffusion Chains, and\
  \ what makes for cultural success. We talk about transmission within and between\
  \ generations. We discuss the evolution of human culture, and why culture is rare\
  \ in the animal kingdom. We also talk about human nature, and ask if there could\
  \ be human societies without culture.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:47  What\
