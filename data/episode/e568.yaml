shownotes: "<p>Dr. \u015Eerife Tekin is an Associate Professor of Philosophy and Director\
  \ of the Medical Humanities program at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA).\
  \ Her work is in philosophy of science/medicine, philosophy of mind/cognitive science\
  \ and bioethics. It is heavily informed by feminist and social epistemology. She\
  \ has two co-edited edited books, The Bloomsbury Companion to Philosophy of Psychiatry,\
  \ and Extraordinary Science and Psychiatry: Responses to the Crisis in Mental Health\
  \ Research, which adopts a Kuhnian approach to make sense of the existing research\
  \ landscape in psychiatry.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about philosophy of\
  \ psychiatry. We first delve into the biological and cultural aspects of mental\
  \ disorders. We discuss how important cultural and social factors are for how people\
  \ deal with mental disorders. We talk about the self and flourishing, and the role\
  \ they play in a clinical context. We talk about how AI is used to treat mental\
  \ disorders, and if we should use it. We talk a bit about the mental effects of\
  \ the covid-19 pandemic, and to what extent it really increased mental illness.\
  \ Finally, we discuss if psychiatry is a science.</p>\n"
