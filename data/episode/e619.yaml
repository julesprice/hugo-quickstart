shownotes: "<p>Dr. Philip Dwyer is Professor in the School of Humanities and Social\
  \ Science at the University of Newcastle, Australia. He has published widely on\
  \ the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, including a three-volume biography of Napoleon.\
  \ He is the general editor of a four volume Cambridge World History of Violence,\
  \ and co-editor of the Cambridge History of the Napoleonic Wars. He is the editor\
  \ of The Darker Angels of Our Nature: Refuting the Pinker Theory of History &amp;\
  \ Violence.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on The Darker Angels of Our Nature.\
  \ We present Steven Pinker\u2019s argument about trends in violence across history.\
  \ We then define \u201Cviolence\u201D, and talk about the limitations of historical\
  \ sources of data. We talk about forms of violence that apparently have been on\
  \ the rise recently. We discuss how to deal with death tolls in war. We talk about\
  \ the historical and cultural context of violence, Norbert Elias\u2019 \u201Ccivilizing\
  \ process\u201D, and the Enlightenment. Finally, we talk about factors identified\
  \ by historians that play a role in violence trends, and ask if it is possible to\
  \ objectively say that there has been moral progress.</p>\n"
