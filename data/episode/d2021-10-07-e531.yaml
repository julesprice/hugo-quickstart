shownotes: "<p>Dr. Kyle Thomas recently received his Ph.D. in experimental psychology\
  \ from Harvard University, where he developed his research program on the psychology\
  \ of common knowledge under his advisor, Steven Pinker. He is currently the Chief\
  \ Scientist at MotiveMetrics, where they turn cutting-edge psychological science\
  \ into software tools that can accurately reveal true motivations from publicly\
  \ available data. In short, they help marketers understand why people buy\u2014\
  or don\u2019t\u2014at the click of a button. Software hasn\u2019t eaten marketing\
  \ research yet, but they\u2019re working very hard to change that.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we talk about common knowledge. We start with some basic definitions\
  \ of private knowledge, shared knowledge, and common knowledge. We then get into\
  \ some examples of domains where common knowledge applies, like economic games,\
  \ self-conscious emotions, charitable behavior, the bystander effect, and indirect\
  \ speech.</p>\n"
