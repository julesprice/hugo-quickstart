shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 23rd, 2019.  \nDr. Jerome Kagan is Professor of Psychology\
  \ Emeritus at Harvard University. Professor Kagan's research, on the cognitive and\
  \ emotional development of a child during the first decade of life, focuses on the\
  \ origins of temperament. He has tracked the development of inhibited and uninhibited\
  \ children from infancy to adolescence. Dr. Kagan\u2019s research indicates that\
  \ shyness and other temperamental differences in adults and children have both environmental\
  \ and genetic influences. A shy adult is more likely to have been high-reactive\
  \ (fearful) in infancy and childhood than their bold and sociable counterparts,\
  \ who were most likely low-reactive. He has served on the National Institute of\
  \ Mental Health and on the National Research Council. His books include Galen\u2019\
  s Prophecy: Temperament in Human Nature and Three Seductive Ideas.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus mostly on the study of temperament. We talk about what temperament is,\
  \ what temperamental traits are, and the reactivity trait. We also distinguish between\
  \ feelings and emotions, and how emotions are culturally constructed. We discuss\
  \ the relationship between temperament, feelings, moods, worldviews, and personality\
  \ traits. Dr. Kagan explains why the second year of life is so important in human\
  \ development, and the kinds of traits that distinguish us from other primates \u2013\
  \ inference, language, morality, and self-consciousness. Finally, we talk about\
  \ how the words we use for emotions might contaminate psychological research, how\
  \ to improve the ways we study feelings, and how culture influences emotions.\n\n\
