shownotes: "<p>Dr. Jerome Kagan is Professor of Psychology Emeritus at Harvard University.\
  \ Professor Kagan's research, on the cognitive and emotional development of a child\
  \ during the first decade of life, focuses on the origins of temperament. He has\
  \ tracked the development of inhibited and uninhibited children from infancy to\
  \ adolescence. Dr. Kagan\u2019s research indicates that shyness and other temperamental\
  \ differences in adults and children have both environmental and genetic influences.\
  \ A shy adult is more likely to have been high-reactive (fearful) in infancy and\
  \ childhood than their bold and sociable counterparts, who were most likely low-reactive.\
  \ He has served on the National Institute of Mental Health and on the National Research\
  \ Council. His books include Galen\u2019s Prophecy: Temperament in Human Nature\
  \ and Three Seductive Ideas.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus mostly on the study\
  \ of temperament. We talk about what temperament is, what temperamental traits are,\
  \ and the reactivity trait. We also distinguish between feelings and emotions, and\
  \ how emotions are culturally constructed. We discuss the relationship between temperament,\
  \ feelings, moods, worldviews, and personality traits. Dr. Kagan explains why the\
  \ second year of life is so important in human development, and the kinds of traits\
  \ that distinguish us from other primates \u2013 inference, language, morality,\
  \ and self-consciousness. Finally, we talk about how the words we use for emotions\
  \ might contaminate psychological research, how to improve the ways we study feelings,\
  \ and how culture influences emotions.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Kagan\u2019\
