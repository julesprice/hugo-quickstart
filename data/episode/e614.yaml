shownotes: "<p>Dr. Andrew Sayer is Emeritus Professor of Social Theory and Political\
  \ Economy at Lancaster University. He is known for significant contributions to\
  \ methodology and theory in the social sciences. He is the author of multiple books,\
  \ including Why We Can't Afford the Rich.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Why\
  \ We Can\u2019t Afford the Rich. We start by talking about economic inequality,\
  \ and how it got worse since the rise of neoliberalism. We define who are the \u201C\
  rich\u201D, and go through how they took control of the economy, how much they really\
  \ contribute to it, how they spend their money, and how they influence politics.\
  \ We talk about the concept of a \u201Cmoral economy\u201D, and earned income and\
  \ meritocracy. We ask if capitalism itself is the problem, and go through some of\
  \ the potential solutions for economic inequality.</p>\n"
