  \ start by covering some of the most prominent theories of language, including nativism,\
  \ constructivism, and functional theories. We then discuss several aspects of native\
  \ language attainment, and also how people acquire second languages. We discuss\
  \ specifically the role of education and inputs. Finally, we discuss the \u201C\
  poverty of the stimulus\u201D argument for nativism.</p>\n"
