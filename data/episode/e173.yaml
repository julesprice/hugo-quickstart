  \ her PhD in Social psychology at Universidad Autonoma de Madrid in 2012, and her\

  \ interpersonal emotion regulation across the lifespan, as well as happiness and\
  \ wellbeing. Her current research projects are focused on interpersonal emotion\
  \ regulation in childhood and developmental differences in emotion goals (i.e.,\
  \ what people would like to feel in different contexts).</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we talk about empathy, emotion regulation, and the unexpected relationship between\
  \ empathy and cruelty. First, we talk about the several cognitive and emotional\
  \ dimensions of empathy. Then, we discuss emotion regulation and how it relates\
  \ to empathy, as well as the developmental stages children go through when it comes\
  \ to emotion regulation. We also refer to the relationship between emotion regulation\
  \ and happiness, and the perils of focusing too much on happiness. Finally, we talk\
  \ about the relationship between empathy and cruelty.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow\
