shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 8th 2022.  \nDr. Kristopher Smith is a postdoc in the\
  \ Human Sociality Lab in the Department of Anthropology at Washington State University,\
  \ where he studies long-distance relationships and natural resource management in\
  \ Tanzania in collaboration with Anne Pisor and Monique Borgerhoff Mulder. This\
  \ project applies evolutionary anthropology to better understand how communities\
  \ can work together to manage shared, open-access fisheries. He previously worked\
  \ as a research associate for the Geography of Philosophy Project, led by Edouard\
  \ Machery, Clark Barrett, and Stephen Stich, examining cultural variation in folk\
  \ concepts of knowledge, wisdom, and reasoning. He also worked with Coren Apicella,\
  \ studying how the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania maintain group cooperation\
  \ and what traits they prefer in potential social partners.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about human cooperation. We start by talking about the aspects of human\
  \ cooperation Dr. Smith focus the most on. We discuss models of human evolution.\
  \ We talk about partner choice models, and the \u201Canomalous-is-bad\u201D stereotype.\
  \ We also discuss if people prefer deontologists or consequentialists when it comes\
  \ to moral character. We discuss long-distance relationships and resource management,\
  \ and how people from different groups maintain cooperation. Throughout the interview\
  \ we focus mostly on the Hadza and people from Tanzania. Finally, we talk about\
  \ human universals and cross-cultural variation.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro \
