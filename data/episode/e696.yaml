  University, Singapore. His research interests include cultural evolution, cognitive
  plasticity, and developmental psychobiology.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about the cultural evolution of genetic heritability.
  Dr. Uchiyama explains the cultural psychobiological framework. We talk about aspects
  of behavior genetics that get reframed in this framework, like heritability, the
  environment, gene-environment interactions, and gene-environment correlations. We
  discuss issues with the generalizability of genetic effects across societies and
  across time, and predicting how heritability should differ between societies, between
  socioeconomic levels, and other groupings within the same society. We get into the
  specific example of IQ, and the Flynn effect. We also talk a bit about personality
  variation across societies, and limitations with the Big Five personality inventory.</p>
