shownotes: "RECORDED ON April 22nd, 2020.  \nDr. Marco Del Giudice is Associate Professor\
  \ in the Department of Psychology at the University of New Mexico. In his work he\
  \ explores a wide range of topics at the intersection of human behavior, evolution,\
  \ and development. His approach is interdisciplinary and driven by the quest for\
  \ theoretical synthesis. Over the years he has developed some broad, integrative\
  \ models: the Adaptive Calibration Model of individual differences in stress responsivity\
  \ (with Bruce Ellis and Birdie Shirtcliff); an evolutionary-developmental model\
  \ of sex differences in attachment styles; and a unifying life history framework\
  \ for evolutionary psychopathology. Most of his current empirical work is devoted\
  \ to testing, advancing, and refining these models with a variety of research methods.\
  \ He\u2019s the author of Evolutionary Psychopathology: A Unified Approach.\n\n\
  In this episode, we focus on psychological gender differences. We talk about personality\
  \ and risk-taking; univariate and multivariate analyses; the interpersonal circumplex\
  \ model; cooperation and competition; and gender differences in verbal and non-verbal\
  \ communication.   \nThis is a 2-part talk on gender differences. The second part\
  \ will probably be released in August 2020.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:33  Gender differences\
