  <p>In this episode, we focus on Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s most recent book, How History\
  \ Gets Things Wrong, and also a little bit on some of the topics of The Atheist\u2019\
  s Guide to Reality. We talk about the theory of mind, and how it evolved; the errors\
  \ with narrative History, and the negative consequences it might produce; mind-brain\
  \ dualism; what neuroscience tells us about how our brain and cognition operate;\
  \ social science, biology, and evolution; the role that evolutionary game theory\
  \ can play in explaining historical events and social phenomena; why beliefs, motivations,\
  \ desires, and other mental constructs might not exist at all, and the implications\
  \ for moral philosophy; if AI could develop these same illusions; and nihilism.</p>\n\
