shownotes: "<p>Dr. Andrew Buskell is a Visiting Assistant Professor at the Georgia\
  \ Institute of Technology\u2019s School of Public Policy. His work analyses issues\
  \ where human cognition, culture, politics, and biology intersect. His current project\
  \ examines the ontological and epistemic assumptions underwriting cross-cultural\
  \ comparison and their implications for research and policy design.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we talk about cultural evolution. We start by discussing what cultural\
  \ evolution is, when it started, and its elements. We talk about a systems approach\
  \ to cultural evolution. We talk about cognitive novelties and how they arise. We\
  \ discuss cumulative culture, its different types (adaptiveness, complexity, efficiency,\
  \ and disparity), and the paradigmatic example of complex hominin technologies.\
  \ We talk about cultural groups, and demographic cultures. We discuss accounts of\
  \ the origins of hierarchy and inequality. We ask if we need an extended evolutionary\
  \ synthesis. Finally, we talk about uniqueness in the life sciences.</p>\n"
