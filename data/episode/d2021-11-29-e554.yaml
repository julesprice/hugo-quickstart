shownotes: '<p>Dr. Felipe De Brigard is Fuchsberg-Levine Family Associate Professor
  at Duke University. Most of his research focuses on the way in which memory and
  imagination interact. So far, he has explored ways in which episodic memory both
  guides and constrains episodic counterfactual thinking (i.e., thoughts about alternative
  ways in which past personal events could have occurred), and how this interaction
  affects the perceived plausibility of imagined counterfactual events. He also explores
  the differential contribution of episodic and semantic memory in the generation
  of different kinds of counterfactual simulations, as well as the effect of counterfactual
  thinking on the memories they derive from. In addition, his research attempts to
  understand how prior experience helps to constrain the way in which we reconstruct
  episodic memories.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about philosophy of neuroscience, and the way in which
  memory and imagination interact. Topics include: episodic and semantic memory; counterfactual
  thinking; autobiographical memory, and life narratives; the importance of forgetting;
  if memory is always conscious; what is imagination, its function, and its relationship
  with memory; and free will and moral responsibility.</p>
