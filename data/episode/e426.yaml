shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 24th 2020.  \nDr. Lyle Steadman is Professor Emeritus\
  \ at Arizona State University. Dr. Steadman focuses on religion and kinship, especially\
  \ their interrelationship, and the influence of natural selection on human social\
  \ and cultural behavior. He has done extensive research among the Hewa, a society\
  \ in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. A short period of fieldwork was also conducted\
  \ in an Indian village in Baja California, Mexico.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ kinship and religion. We first discuss the Hewa, and then get into aspects of\
  \ human sociality, and go through topics like kin selection, group selection, kinship\
  \ systems, tradition, ancestor worship, religion, and shamanism.\n\nTime Links:\
