  \ Professor of Social & Natural Science, and Professor of Internal Medicine and\
  \ General Medicine at Yale University. He\u2019s a sociologist and physician known\
  \ for his research on social networks and on the socioeconomic, biosocial, and evolutionary\
  \ determinants of behavior, health, and longevity. Dr. Christakis was elected a\
  \ Fellow of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences in 2006;\
  \ of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2010; and of the\
  \ American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2017. In 2009, he was named to the Time\

  \ 2009 and again in 2010, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine to its list of\
  \ top global thinkers. He\u2019s the author of Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins\
  \ of a Good Society.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on his most recent book, Blueprint.\
  \ We talk about the human social suite, and human universals and variation across\
  \ societies. We also refer to our tribal aspects, and how that might present some\
  \ obstacles in expanding our societies further. We discuss natural experiments,\
  \ focusing on intentional communities, and how important it is to respect individual\
  \ variation. Finally, we talk about how we can address the current problem of political\
  \ polarization.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:47  The social suite  \n04:26  About human\
