shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 12th 2020.  \nDr. Christian List is Professor of\
  \ Philosophy and Decision Theory at LMU Munich and Co-Director of the Munich Center\
  \ for Mathematical Philosophy. He\u2019s the author of Why Free Will Is Real.\n\n\
  In this episode, we talk about Why Free Will Is Real. We start with some basic questions,\
  \ like what is free will, and what is an agent. We then get into the moral side\
  \ of things, and talk about moral responsibility and the law. We address three major\
  \ challenges to free will (the \u201Cchallenge from radical materialism,\u201D the\
  \ \u201Cchallenge from determinism,\u201D and the \u201Cchallenge from epiphenomenalism\u201D\
  ). We discuss mind-brain dualism and emergentism. Finally, we ask if free will exists\
  \ in other living beings, in nonliving entities, and in robots and advanced AI.\n\
