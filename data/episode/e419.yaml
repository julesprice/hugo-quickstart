shownotes: "<p>Dr. Christian List is Professor of Philosophy and Decision Theory at\
  \ LMU Munich and Co-Director of the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy. He\u2019\
  s the author of Why Free Will Is Real.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about Why\
  \ Free Will Is Real. We start with some basic questions, like what is free will,\
  \ and what is an agent. We then get into the moral side of things, and talk about\
  \ moral responsibility and the law. We address three major challenges do free will\
  \ (the \u201Cchallenge from radical materialism,\u201D the \u201Cchallenge from\
  \ determinism,\u201D and the \u201Cchallenge from epiphenomenalism\u201D). We discuss\
  \ mind-brain dualism and emergentism. Finally, we ask if free will exists in other\
  \ living beings, in nonliving entities, and in robots and advanced AI.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
