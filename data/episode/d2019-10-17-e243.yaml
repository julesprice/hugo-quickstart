shownotes: "<p>Dr. Lars Penke is Full Professor of Biological Personality Psychology\
  \ at the Georg August University of G\xF6ttingen. His research interests include\
  \ the evolutionary significance of individual differences, social endocrinology,\
  \ links of somatometric measures of the body and face with psychological traits,\
  \ the evolutionary psychology of mate choice, romantic relationships and sexuality,\
  \ neurostructural indicators of intelligence and cognitive ageing, behavior genetics,\
  \ and life history theory.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about personality, intelligence,\
  \ and mate preferences from an evolutionary perspective. We start with personality,\
  \ and go through the several different hypotheses for the evolutionary genetics\
  \ of personality. We also discuss the literature on personality calibration, and\
  \ the one on birth order effects. We refer to the limitations of personality inventories\
  \ (including the Big Five), and then talk about how intelligence correlates with\
  \ different indicators of robust brain development. We talk about the heritability\
  \ of intelligence, and different approaches to try to identify the genes associated\
  \ with it, like GWAS and GCTA. Finally, we discuss some literature on mate preferences.\
  \ We talk about speed-dating scenarios, and what we can learn from them; and changes\
  \ in women\u2019s sexuality across their menstrual cycle, particularly in the ovulatory\
  \ phase (or the luteal phase).</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Penke\u2019s work:</p>\n\
