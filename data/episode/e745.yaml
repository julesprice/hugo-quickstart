  \ He is interested in media violence and, in particular, video games. He\u2019s\
  \ the author of Catastrophe!: How Psychology Explains Why Good People Make Bad Situations\
  \ Worse.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on \u201CCatastrophe!\u201D. We talk\
  \ about the cognitive biases that people have during emergencies. We get into topics\
  \ like trends in suicide rates and blaming social media for it, views on relationships\
  \ between races in the US. We discuss if the idea of the \u201Cmadness of crowds\u201D\
  \ is useful, and availability cascades and social contagion. We talk about how the\
  \ COVID-19 pandemic became another culture war. We also get into terrorism statistics\
  \ and how people overreact to it, and the causes of violence and its link to mental\
  \ disorder. We discuss why it is so hard to tackle climate change. Finally, we talk\
  \ about how we can manage crises better.</p>\n"
