  \ of psychology at Stetson University. He is interested in media violence and, in\

  \ if the idea of the \u201Cmadness of crowds\u201D is useful, and availability cascades\
  \ and social contagion. We talk about how the COVID-19 pandemic became another culture\
  \ war. We also get into terrorism statistics and how people overreact to it, and\
  \ the causes of violence and its link to mental disorder. We discuss why it is so\
  \ hard to tackle climate change. Finally, we talk about how we can manage crises\
  \ better. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:38  How people react to catastrophe:\
