shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 15th 2022.  \nDr. Annie Wertz is Research Group Leader\
  \ of the MPRG Naturalistic Social Cognition at the Max Planck Institute for Human\
  \ Development, Berlin. Her research investigates how infants and young children\
  \ think about and learn from other people in naturalistic circumstances. Her work\
  \ provided the first evidence that human infants do indeed possess behavioral and\
  \ social learning strategies that are selective to plants (e.g., infants avoid plant\
  \ dangers and selectively learn that some plants are edible). Her research provides\
  \ a window into the complex interplay of evolutionary and developmental factors\
  \ that allow human beings to learn from others and accumulate cultural knowledge.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about how infants acquire information about plants. We\
  \ discuss why we have evolved this capacity, and how people categorize plants. We\
  \ talk about core knowledge, and the domain of folk biology. We get into the developmental\
  \ aspects of it, and discuss innateness and human universals. We also go through\
  \ more general questions, having to do with how this connects to other aspects of\
  \ human cognition, the interplay between evolutionary and developmental psychology,\
  \ the relationship between evolutionary psychology and cultural evolutionary theory,\
  \ and how cultural knowledge becomes cumulative.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro \
