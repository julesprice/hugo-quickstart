shownotes: '<p>Dr. Annie Wertz is Research Group Leader of the MPRG Naturalistic Social
  Cognition at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin. Her research
  investigates how infants and young children think about and learn from other people
  in naturalistic circumstances. Her work provided the first evidence that human infants
  do indeed possess behavioral and social learning strategies that are selective to
  plants (e.g., infants avoid plant dangers and selectively learn that some plants
  are edible).</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about how infants acquire information about plants.
  We discuss why we have evolved this capacity, and how people categorize plants.
  We talk about core knowledge, and the domain of folk biology. We get into the developmental
  aspects of it, and discuss innateness and human universals. We also go through more
  general questions, having to do with how this connects to other aspects of human
  cognition, the interplay between evolutionary and developmental psychology, the
  relationship between evolutionary psychology and cultural evolutionary theory, and
  how cultural knowledge becomes cumulative.</p>
