shownotes: "<p>Dr. Sarah Brosnan is a Professor in the departments of psychology and\
  \ philosophy and the Neuroscience Institute at Georgia State University. She is\
  \ also a member of the Brains &amp; Behavior program and the Center for Behavioral\
  \ Neuroscience. She directs the Comparative Economics and Behavioral Studies Laboratory\
  \ (CEBUS Lab) and does research with nonhuman primates at both the Language Research\
  \ Center of Georgia State University and the Michale E. Keeling Center for Comparative\
  \ Medicine and Research of the University of Texas Anderson Cancer Center. She studies\
  \ the mechanisms underlying cooperation, reciprocity, inequity, and other economic\
  \ decisions in nonhuman primates from an evolutionary perspective. She looks at\
  \ the decisions individuals make and how they make them, how their social or ecological\
  \ environments affect their decisions and interactions, and under what circumstances\
  \ they can alter their behaviors depending on these conditions.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we talk about biology, comparative psychology, and moral behavior. First,\
  \ Dr. Brosnan tells us about the primates that she studies the most and the sorts\
  \ of behaviors she\u2019s most interested in. Then, we discuss how to properly do\
  \ comparative psychology, and compare the behavior of humans to other species, particularly\
  \ primates. We also talk about what is morality from a biological perspective and\
  \ its functions. And very important to understand morality are the processes of\
  \ kin selection, reciprocal altruism, and the contentious topic of group selection.\
  \ After that, we talk about some specific moral behaviors, like inequity aversion\
  \ and the sense of fairness, and the endowment effect and the sense of property,\
  \ in nonhuman primates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:55 The\
