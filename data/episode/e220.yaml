shownotes: "<p>Dr. Cory Clark is an Assistant Professor of Social Psychology at Durham\
  \ University, UK. Dr. Clark does research in Moral Psychology, Political Psychology,\
  \ Experimental Philosophy, and Motivated Cognition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dr. Bo Winegard\
  \ is Assistant Professor of Psychology at Marietta College. He generally approaches\
  \ psychological puzzles from an evolutionary perspective, applying Darwin's theory\
  \ of natural selection to the human mind. He focuses mostly on status, group differences,\
  \ individual differences, bias, methods, and political psychology.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They\
  \ are both cohosts of the Psyphilopod podcast.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we go over\
  \ some broad topics in the history of Psychology, and its approaches and theoretical\
  \ foundations. We start off by asking if Freud really made any significant contributions\
  \ to the field. Then, we get into how folk psychology intuitions might get in the\
  \ way of proper research. We discuss the replication crisis, and what it really\
  \ means. We get into a discussion surrounding mind-brain dualism, and also to what\
  \ extent conscious processes have any causal powers in people\u2019s psychology\
  \ and behavior. We also talk about the example of cognitive dissonance and how it\
  \ has been misinterpreted as a phenomenon by social psychologists. Toward the end,\
  \ we also have time to put some controversial evolutionary psychology hypotheses\
  \ on the table.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow their work!</p>\n<p>Cory Clark:</p>\n\
