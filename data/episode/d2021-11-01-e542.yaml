shownotes: "<p>Dr. Paul Bloom is Professor Emeritus at Yale University and Professor\
  \ of Psychology at the University of Toronto. His new book is The Sweet Spot: The\
  \ Pleasures of Suffering and the Search for Meaning.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we\
  \ focus on The Sweet Spot. We start with a few definitions (pleasure, suffering,\
  \ happiness, and meaning). We then get into topics like: the difference between\
  \ chosen and unchosen suffering; the relationship between happiness and meaning;\
  \ motivational pluralism; the difference between suffering for pleasure, and suffering\
  \ for meaning; the role context plays in how we valuate our experiences; the complicated\
  \ interplay between pain and pleasure; masochism, self-harm, and BDSM; the state\
  \ of flow; boredom; the role of imagination; how we derive pleasure from moral punishment;\
  \ what people find meaningful; narratives and meaning; why are so many people suffering\
  \ in industrialized societies; the Nozick experience machine, and if it is possible\
  \ for people to do without suffering; and where we can find the \u201Csweet spot\u201D\
