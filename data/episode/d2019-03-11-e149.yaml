  \ is entitled Killing the Competition: Economic Inequality and Homicide.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, the conversation revolves around violence and homicide, and\
  \ the main topics of the books Homicide and Killing the Competition. First, we talk\
  \ about the evolutionary bases of violent behavior, as a means of controlling other\
  \ people\u2019s behavior and regulating relationships. We also go through the evolved\
  \ sex differences in aggressiveness, as a result of intrasexual and intersexual\
  \ competition. Then, we talk specifically about homicide, and why it might also\
  \ happen in familial conflicts, even though it is quite rare. We also refer to the\
  \ potential problems with having an approach that favors pathologizing all types\
  \ of violent and deviant behavior. Finally, we talk about the relationship between\
  \ economic inequality and homicide, as explored in Killing the Competition, and\
  \ how it affects primarily young men, and the environmental and social circumstances\
  \ that trigger it. Toward the end, we also refer to the importance of the State\
  \ having the monopoly over violence and its relationship with social stability,\
  \ and the benefits that we get from economic redistribution. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n\
