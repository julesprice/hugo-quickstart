  Studies. He has been a visiting researcher at the Department of Philosophy, Canada,

  <p>In this episode, we talk about metaethics. We start by discussing what the most
  basic questions in metaethics are, how ethics can be objective, and the metaphysical
  status of moral facts. We talk about the relationship between preferences, values,
  and wellbeing. We get into population ethics, and discuss questions related to future
  demographics, climate change, and social security. Finally, we discuss antinatalism,
  if life is worth starting, and if we can determine objectively the amount of good
  and bad in human life.</p>
