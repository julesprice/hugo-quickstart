shownotes: '<p>Dr. Denis Tatone is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Cognitive Development
  Center at Central European University. He is a cognitive scientist broadly interested
  in the evolution and development of social cognition. His research focuses on how
  the mind represents the social world in terms of its constituent interactions, relations,
  and structures. He strives to develop a mechanistically tractable account of how
  humans from the first years of life form and flexibly transition among these representations.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about how infants interpret giving and taking actions,
  and the development of prosociality. We start with giving and taking actions, and
  talk about expectations surrounding giving; how infants think about possession;
  norms of ownership, and how they vary cross-culturally; expectations surrounding
  reciprocation; how infants infer social relations from giving and taking actions;
  and how giving actions influence how they encode objects. We then get into prosociality,
  and ask if infants prefer helpers or hinderers. Finally, we discuss if there are
  stages of development for prosociality.</p>
