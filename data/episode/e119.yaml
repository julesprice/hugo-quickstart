shownotes: "<p>Dr. Terrence Deacon is currently Professor of Anthropology and member\
  \ of the Cognitive Science faculty at the University of California, Berkeley. His\
  \ theoretical interests include the study of evolution-like processes at multiple\
  \ levels, including their role in embryonic development, neural signal processing,\
  \ language change, social processes, and focusing especially on how these different\
  \ processes interact and depend on each other. Professor Deacon's research has combined\
  \ human evolutionary biology and neuroscience, with the aim of investigating the\
  \ evolution of human cognition. He\u2019s the author of The Symbolic Species: The\
  \ Coevolution of Language and the Brain, and his most recent book, Incomplete Nature:\
  \ How Mind Emerged from Matter, explores the relationship between thermodynamic,\
  \ self-organizing, evolutionary and semiotic processes and provides a new technical\
  \ conception of information that explains both its representational and normative\
  \ properties.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we cover some of the major topics of Incomplete\
  \ Nature, including: the second law of thermodynamics; absence and constraints;\
  \ homeodynamics, morphodynamics, and teleodynamics; information; emergence; how\
  \ we get from Physics to mental phenomena. We also talk about language and semiotics,\
  \ including the biological bases of language, and how to study its evolution.</p>\n\
