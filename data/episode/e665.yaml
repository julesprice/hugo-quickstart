shownotes: "<p>Dr. Scott Grafton is Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the University\
  \ of California Santa Barbara. Dr. Grafton is interested in how people organize\
  \ movement into goal-oriented action. The emphasis is on elucidating the cognitive\
  \ architecture that underlies action representation. He is the author of Physical\
  \ Intelligence: The Science of How the Body and the Mind Guide Each Other Through\
  \ Life.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Physical Intelligence. We talk about\
  \ physical intelligence and embodied cognition. We get into topics like: how we\
  \ create a \u201Cmental space\u201D; attention and vigilance; affordances; body\
  \ schema and body self-image; and how people learn new skills. We discuss the relationship\
  \ between the brain and the rest of the body, modularity of mind, and artificial\
  \ intelligence.</p>\n"
