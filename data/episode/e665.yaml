shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 23rd 2022.  \nDr. Scott Grafton is Distinguished Professor\
  \ of Psychology at the University of California Santa Barbara. Dr. Grafton is interested\
  \ in how people organize movement into goal-oriented action. The emphasis is on\
  \ elucidating the cognitive architecture that underlies action representation. This\
  \ is developed with studies of sequence and skill acquisition, motor simulation,\
  \ sensorimotor transformation, on-line control and action observation experiments.\
  \ He is the author of Physical Intelligence: The Science of How the Body and the\
  \ Mind Guide Each Other Through Life.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Physical Intelligence.\
  \ We talk about physical intelligence and embodied cognition. We get into topics\
  \ like: how we create a \u201Cmental space\u201D; attention and vigilance; affordances;\
  \ body schema and body self-image; and how people learn new skills. We discuss the\
  \ relationship between the brain and the rest of the body, modularity of mind, and\
  \ artificial intelligence.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:42  What is physical\
  \ intelligence?  \n09:09  How do we create a \u201Cmental space\u201D?  \n12:26\
  \  Attention and vigilance  \n21:59  Affordances  \n27:53  Body schema and body\
  \ self-image  \n37:00  How much feedback from the brain does the body need?  \n\
  40:52  How people learn new skills  \n44:32  Do tools become part of a person\u2019\
