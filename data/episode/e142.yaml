shownotes: "<p>Dr. James Tabery is Adjunct Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Adjunct\
  \ Associate Professor of Internal Medicine and Associate Professor of Philosophy\
  \ at the University of Utah. His research focuses largely on the philosophy of science\
  \ and applied ethics, as well as the intersection between those domains. On the\
  \ philosophy of science side, he investigates questions of causation and explanation\
  \ in biology; while on the applied ethics side, he explores how the answers to those\
  \ questions have ethical, legal, and social implications. He\u2019s also the author\
  \ of the book Beyond Versus: The Struggle to Understand the Interaction of Nature\
  \ and Nurture.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on some of the main topics of Dr.\
  \ Tabery\u2019s book, Beyond Versus. We go through the historical origins of the\
  \ nature-nurture debate, and the early stages of Biology, and the influences of\
  \ genetics and the study of development. Then, we address the complexity of the\
  \ interaction between genes and the environment, and how they mediate each other\u2019\
  s effects on the organism. And we finish up with a couple of questions about the\
  \ ethical implications of this science, including the dangers of focusing too much\
  \ on nature, or believing in extreme environmentalism and views of the mind as a\
  \ blank slate, and also the technical and ethical limitations to gene editing, human\
  \ enhancement and eugenics.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:48 The origins of the\
