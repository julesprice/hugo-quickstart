shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 16th, 2020.  \nDr. Ian Tattersall is currently curator\
  \ emeritus in the Division of Anthropology of the American Museum of Natural History\
  \ in New York City. He has carried out both primatological and paleontological fieldwork\
  \ in countries as diverse as Madagascar, Vietnam, Surinam, Yemen, and Mauritius.\
  \ Trained in archaeology and anthropology at the University of Cambridge, and in\
  \ geology and vertebrate paleontology at Yale University, Dr. Tattersall has concentrated\
  \ his research since the 1960s in three main areas: the analysis of the human fossil\
  \ record and its integration with evolutionary theory, the origin of human cognition,\
  \ and the study of the ecology and systematics of the lemurs of Madagascar. He is\
  \ also a prominent interpreter of human paleontology to the public, with numerous\
  \ trade books to his credit, as well as several articles in Scientific American\
  \ and the co-editorship of the definitive Encyclopedia of Human Evolution and Prehistory.\
  \ \n\nIn this episode, we talk about the study of the human fossil record, and several\
  \ aspects of human evolution, with a focus on the genus Homo. We discuss how the\
  \ Pleistocene conditions might have affected human evolution; the role of culture;\
  \ and the cognitive revolution. We also refer to what is a modern human, and the\
  \ evolution of language and symbolism. Finally, we tackle narratives in the paleosciences,\
  \ like the one about human races and the relative importance of natural selection\
  \ in comparison with cultural selection.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:27  Studying the human\
