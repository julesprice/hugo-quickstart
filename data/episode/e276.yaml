  \ University. He holds a ScD and a Masters of Linguistics from the Universidade\
  \ Estadual in Campinas (UNICAMP). He is well-known for his many years of field research\
  \ among the Pirah\xE3 people of the Brazilian Amazon jungle. Dr. Everett's books\
  \ include Dark Matter of the Mind: The Culturally Articulated Unconscious, and How\
  \ Language Began: The Story of Humanity's Greatest Invention.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we talk about linguistics, and the Pirah\xE3. First, Dr. Everett distinguishes\
  \ between communication and language. He also refers to issues with Universal Grammar,\
  \ and gives us his account of why H. erectus should have been the first hominin\
  \ to have language. We talk about the biological tools needed for language, and\
  \ the limitations in other primates\u2019 use of sign language. We refer to three\
  \ different types of language (G1, G2, and G3), cultural evolution, the universal\
  \ traits of language, and difficulties in distinguishing between different languages.\
  \ We discuss the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis, and if there is evidence that language\
  \ influences thinking. Finally, in the last ten minutes, Dr. Everett talks about\
  \ the Pirah\xE3 society, their culture and language.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr.\
