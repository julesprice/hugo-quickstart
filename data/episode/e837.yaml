  \ effect\u201D; behavioral contagion; first impressions; assertiveness; the domains\

  s hard to say \u201Cno\u201D; why people in positions of power underestimate the\
  \ negative impact they have on others; and other topics. We talk about ways by which\
  \ we can become more aware and mindful of our influence on others. Finally, we discuss\
  \ if influencers and gurus are preying on our insecurities to sell their products.\n\
