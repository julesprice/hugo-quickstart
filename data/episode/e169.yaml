shownotes: "Dr. Bo Winegard is Assistant Professor of Psychology at Marietta College.\
  \ He generally approaches psychological puzzles from an evolutionary perspective,\
  \ applying Darwin's theory of natural selection to the human mind. He focuses mostly\
  \ on status, group differences, individual differences, bias, methods, and political\
  \ psychology. He\u2019s also the cohost, together with Cory Clark, of the Psyphilopod\
  \ podcast.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the study of group differences in Psychology.\
  \ We also discuss the importance of acknowledging the impact of liberal political\
  \ biases in psychological research, and even research in the social sciences at\
  \ large, and science denialism by people from both sides of the political spectrum.\
  \ Toward the end, we discuss some issues in Evolutionary Psychology, like trying\
  \ to reconcile research on human universals and a panhuman nature perspective with\
  \ intergroup and interindividual variation, and the strawman arguments drawn against\
  \ Evolutionary Psychology, and also the way it gets misrepresented in Sex and Gender\
  \ textbooks.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:55  Addressing group differences in Psychology\
