  \ we focus on The Big Myth. We start by discussing the premise of the book, and\
  \ how it ties to Merchants of Doubt. We talk about the ideology of \u201Cfree market\
  \ fundamentalism\u201D, and how it was sold and went mainstream, including a tripod\
  \ of freedom, and campaigns to rewrite textbooks. We discuss the rise of neoliberalism,\
  \ the changes it brought, and its most severe social and economic effects, including\
  \ the return of child labor in the US. Finally, we discuss if these are inevitable\
  \ effects of capitalism, and what scientists and science communicators can learn\
  \ from the book.</p>\n"
