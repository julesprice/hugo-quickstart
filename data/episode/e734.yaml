shownotes: "<p>Dr. Helena Miton is Complexity Postdoctoral Fellow at the Santa Fe\
  \ Institute. Dr. Miton\u2019s research agenda approaches culture as an emergent\
  \ effect of human everyday life. It aims to understand how individuals interact\
  \ to produce, organize and transmit cultural systems. She studies cultural evolution\
  \ using data from human and social sciences, with a strong emphasis on cognitive\
  \ science.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about how we can study culture through\
  \ cognitive science. We discuss lab studies and their limitations. We talk about\
  \ mechanisms of cultural transmission, and cultural stability. We discuss if cumulative\
  \ culture needs high-fidelity copying. We go through cultural phenomena like maladaptive\
  \ medical practices, and the evolution of complexity in graphic communication systems,\
  \ like heraldry and writing. We discuss how we go from small-scale interactions\
  \ to large-scale cultural productions. Finally, we talk about the cultural transmission\
  \ of tacit knowledge.</p>\n"
