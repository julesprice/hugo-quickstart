shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 27th 2022.  \nDr. Melanie MacEacheron is a Lecturer\
  \ in the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Arizona State University. Her\
  \ current research focus is women's psychology as potential or actual mothers or\
  \ allomothers, and sex differences in mateships and romantic relationships. Of particular\
  \ interest to her, is our ability to creatively label or act on evolved desires\
  \ in order to serve our evolutionary interests, even or especially where these are\
  \ not consciously known to us, and to influence others.\n\nIn this episode, we focus\
  \ mostly on motherhood and marital surname changes. We start with the questions\
  \ that the evolutionary psychology of motherhood focusses on, and also discuss allomothering.\
  \ We talk about sex differences in mateships and romantic relationships. We discuss\
  \ marital surname changes and several factors and predictors associated with them,\
  \ like earning capacity and economic inequality. We also discuss outcomes like marital\
  \ duration, and number of children. Finally, we ask if feminism and evolutionary\
  \ psychology really need to be in conflict with one another.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
