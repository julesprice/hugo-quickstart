shownotes: "<p>Dr. Andrew Thomas is a Lecturer in Psychology at Swansea University,\
  \ UK. His research is concerned with the differences in mating strategies within\
  \ and between the sexes. This includes environmental and social factors which contribute\
  \ to this variance and whether mating preferences themselves are reactive to environmental\
  \ changes over short-term periods.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about mating,\
  \ mate preferences, and cyberpsychology. We start with the ovulatory-shift hypothesis,\
  \ and ask if women seek out extra-pair copulations at peak fertility. We then get\
  \ into mating, and discuss the mate preference priority model, and what are people\u2019\
  s priorities when it comes to mate preferences, and how they vary cross-culturally.\
  \ We talk about how testosterone might be related to mating strategy changes in\
  \ men. We talk about sociosexuality, sexual compulsivity, and fetishes related to\
  \ them, like voyeurism and exhibitionism. We discuss a Psychology Today post by\
  \ Dr. Thomas - Will Men Really Sleep With Just About Anyone? We talk about the distinction\
  \ between sex and gender. We discuss the MCFC (Males Compete Females Chose) model,\
  \ and the MMC (Mutual Mate Choice) model of sexual selection.</p>\n"
