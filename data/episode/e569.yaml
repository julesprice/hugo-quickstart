shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 13th 2021.  \nDr. Andrew Thomas is a Lecturer in\
  \ Psychology at Swansea University, UK. His research is concerned with the differences\
  \ in mating strategies within and between the sexes. This includes environmental\
  \ and social factors which contribute to this variance and whether mating preferences\
  \ themselves are reactive to environmental changes over short-term periods. He also\
  \ has a secondary interest in cyber-psychology and online interaction; particularly\
  \ how one represents oneself using internet avatars and aliases.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about mating, mate preferences, and cyberpsychology. We start with the\
  \ ovulatory-shift hypothesis, and ask if women seek out extra-pair copulations at\
  \ peak fertility. We then get into mating, and discuss the mate preference priority\
  \ model, and what are people\u2019s priorities when it comes to mate preferences,\
  \ and how they vary cross-culturally. We talk about how testosterone might be related\
  \ to mating strategy changes in men. We talk about sociosexuality, sexual compulsivity,\
  \ and fetishes related to them, like voyeurism and exhibitionism. We discuss a Psychology\
  \ Today post by Dr. Thomas - Will Men Really Sleep With Just About Anyone? We talk\
  \ about the distinction between sex and gender. We discuss the MCFC (Males Compete\
  \ Females Chose) model, and the MMC (Mutual Mate Choice) model of sexual selection.\
