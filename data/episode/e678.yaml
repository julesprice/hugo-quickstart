  <p>In this episode, we talk about sexual orientation from an anthropological perspective.
  We first talk about the societies Dr. Herdt studied in Papua New Guinea. We then
  discuss how to study sexuality on the field, how sexual attraction develops, the
  influence of culture in the development of sexual orientation, and norms regarding
  sexual behavior. We talk about how to understand homosexuality from the perspective
  of anthropology. Finally, we talk about factors that impact the mental health of
  homosexuals, including norms, marriage denial, and discrimination due to the AIDS
  pandemic.</p>
