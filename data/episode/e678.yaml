shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 30th 2022.  \nDr. Gilbert Herdt is Emeritus Professor\
  \ of Human Sexuality Studies and Anthropology and a Founder of the Department of\
  \ Sexuality Studies and the National Sexuality Resource Center at San Francisco\
  \ State University. He founded the Summer Institute on Sexuality and Society at\
  \ the University of Amsterdam (1996). He founded the PhD Program in Human Sexuality\
  \ at the California Institute for Integral Studies, San Francisco (2013). He conducted\
  \ long-term fieldwork among the Sambia people of Papua New Guinea, and has written\
  \ widely on the nature and variation in human sexual expression in Papua New Guinea,\
  \ Melanesia, and across cultures.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about sexual orientation\
  \ from an anthropological perspective. We first talk about the societies Dr. Herdt\
  \ studied in Papua New Guinea. We then discuss how to study sexuality on the field,\
  \ how sexual attraction develops, the influence of culture in the development of\
  \ sexual orientation, and norms regarding sexual behavior. We talk about how to\
  \ understand homosexuality from the perspective of anthropology. Finally, we talk\
  \ about factors that impact the mental health of homosexuals, including norms, marriage\
  \ denial, and discrimination due to the AIDS pandemic.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
