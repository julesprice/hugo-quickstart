  interested in the mechanisms underlying our human sensitivity to power, status,
  and group membership: their origins, interactions, and manifestation in societal

  <p>In this episode, we talk about evolutionary and social psychology. We discuss
  if humans are a hierarchical species, and how to understand power and status from
  an evolutionary perspective. We talk about group identity, and how people form it.
  We get into social dominance orientation, how it shapes our worldview, and is relationship
  with political ideology. We talk about the effects of poverty on human psychology,
  and how people perceive social inequality. We touch on the psychological effects
  of the 2008 economic crisis, and the potential ones we can see from this pandemic.
  We wrap things up by discussing how to integrate evolutionary and social psychology.</p>
