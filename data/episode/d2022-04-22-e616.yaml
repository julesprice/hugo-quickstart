  <p>In this episode, we talk about environmental philosophy. We start by exploring
  what environmental philosophy is, a bit of its history, and the questions it deals
  it. We then focus on environmental ethics, and paradigms like evolutionary moral
  psychology and rational individualism. We discuss the relationship between environmental
  ethics and environmental science. We talk about climate change, solutions to it,
  the role of philosophers, and if we can be optimistic about it. Finally, we ask
  what we can learn from Eastern philosophy.</p>
