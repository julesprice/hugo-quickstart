  <p>In this episode, we talk about ovulatory shifts, physical attractiveness, and
  psychological adaptations and exaptations. We start with the ovulatory-shift hypothesis,
  and the several controversies surrounding it, and what we know and do not know about
  ovulation and its psychological effects on women. We talk about the evolution of
  human physical attractiveness. Toward the end, we discuss the best way to understand
  the evolution of phenotypic traits, and adaptationist and exaptationist programs.
  Finally, we discuss the relationship between life history theory and evolutionary
  psychology.</p>
