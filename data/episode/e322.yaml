shownotes: "<p>Dr. Curtis Marean is Foundation Professor and Associate Director at\
  \ the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University. Dr. Marean\u2019s\
  \ research interests focus on the origins of modern humans, the prehistory of Africa,\
  \ the study of animal bones from archaeological sites and climates and environments\
  \ of the past. In the area of the origins of modern humans, he is particularly interested\
  \ in questions about foraging strategies and the evolution of modern human behavior.\
  \ He has a special interest in human occupation of grassland and coastal ecosystems.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we start by talking about zooarchaeology, and Integrating paleoanthropology,\
  \ paleoclimate and paleoenvironments. We then discuss the importance of stone tools\
  \ and fire in human evolution. We also refer to what it is to be a modern human.\
  \ We address the limitations of foraging models. We explore how culture might have\
  \ evolved in humans. Finally, we talk about our possible origins and migrations.</p>\n\
