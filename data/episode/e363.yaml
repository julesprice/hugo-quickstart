shownotes: "<p>Dr. Nina G. Jablonski is Evan Pugh University Professor of Anthropology\
  \ at The Pennsylvania State University. A biological anthropologist and paleobiologist,\
  \ she studies the evolution of adaptations to the environment in Old World primates\
  \ including humans. Her research program is focused in two major areas. Her paleoanthropological\
  \ research concerns the evolutionary history of Old World monkeys, and currently\
  \ includes an active field project in China. Her research on the evolution of human\
  \ adaptations to the environment centers on the evolution of human skin and skin\
  \ pigmentation, and includes an active field project examining the relationship\
  \ between skin pigmentation and vitamin D production.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we\
  \ talk about the evolution of skin pigmentation and the social implications of racism.\
  \ We start with how we evolved a skin that has much less hair, and is darker and\
  \ sweatier than our ancestors\u2019. We also mention depigmentation as an adaptation\
  \ to places where people are exposed to less sunlight and UV radiation. We talk\
  \ about the importance of vitamin D, and urbanization and modern migration as a\
  \ cause of vitamin D deficiency. Finally, we discuss scientific and philosophical\
  \ racism.</p>\n"
