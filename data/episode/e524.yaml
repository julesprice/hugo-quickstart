shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 11th 2021.  \nDr. Andrew Guess is an assistant professor\
  \ of politics and public affairs at Princeton University. His research and teaching\
  \ interests lie at the intersection of political communication, public opinion,\
  \ and political behavior. Via a combination of experimental methods, large datasets,\
  \ machine learning, and innovative measurement, he studies how people choose, process,\
  \ spread, and respond to information about politics. Recent work investigates the\
  \ extent to which online Americans' news habits are polarized (the popular \"echo\
  \ chambers\" hypothesis), patterns in the consumption and spread of online misinformation,\
  \ and the effectiveness of efforts to counteract misperceptions encountered on social\
  \ media.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about political polarization, misinformation,\
  \ and digital media literacy. We start with online political polarization, and the\
  \ phenomenon of eco chambers. We get into misinformation and fake news on digital\
  \ media. We ask if political ads work, and if online surveys are reliable. Finally,\
  \ we talk about some of the solutions to fight back against misinformation, including\
  \ fact-checking and digital media literacy. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n\
