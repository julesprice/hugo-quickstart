  \ talk about topics in evolutionary anthropology, including: long-distance relationships,\
  \ and how they\u2019re built; inter-group tolerance; studying human sociality in\
  \ preliterate societies, and the assumptions we have about them; parochial altruism;\
  \ how people valuate out-group strangers; Dr. Pisor\u2019s fieldwork in the Bolivian\
  \ Amazon and Tanzania; and climate change, how it affects human societies, how they\
  \ adapt to it, and what industrialized societies can learn from them.\n\nTime Links:\
