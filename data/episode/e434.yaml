shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 10th 2020.  \nThomas Coleman III is PhD student at\
  \ Coventry University, and a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Bialystok\
  \ as part of the Society and Cognition Unit. He draws on multiple approaches from\
  \ across the sciences and humanities, to study the origins, development, and maintenance\
  \ of (non)religious worldviews. His research focuses on three areas: Identifying\
  \ and measuring components of nonreligious worldviews; computer simulated models\
  \ of the cognitive and social dynamics leading to (non)belief in supernatural agents;\
  \ investigating how and why moral motivations are stereotypically attributed to\
  \ religious, as opposed to nonreligious factors.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ the psychology of believes and nonbelievers. We start with some of the psychological\
  \ differences between religious people and atheists. We deal with the case of agnosticism.\
  \ We discuss phenomena like absorption and mentalizing. We talk about worldviews,\
  \ and fatalism and nihilism. We also go through what we can learn from pilgrimage\
  \ studies, the four different kinds of religious orientation, and where atheist\
  \ derive value and meaning from. Toward the end, we discuss the evolutionary bases\
  \ of atheism, and Thomas tells us about a Postdoc project he is part of: Religion,\
  \ Ideology & Prosociality: Simulating Secularising Societies.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
