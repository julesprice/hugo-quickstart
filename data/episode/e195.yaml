shownotes: "Dr. Todd Shackelford is a Distinguished Professor and Chair of Psychology\
  \ at Oakland University, as well as the Co-Director of the Evolutionary Psychology\
  \ Lab there. He is the editor in chief of the academic journals Evolutionary Psychology\
  \ and Evolutionary Psychological Science. He is a fellow of the American Psychological\
  \ Association and the Association for Psychological Science.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we explore the evolution of human violence. At the beginning, we define violence,\
  \ and talk about ways of creating a classification system for it. We then get into\
  \ three main types of violence and many of their ramifications \u2013 dyadic violence,\
  \ collective/social violence, and self-inflicted violence. In dyadic violence, we\
  \ discuss mostly violence within and between the sexes and violence within families.\
  \ After that, we talk about collective violence, the relationship between morality\
  \ and violence, war, collective punishment of individuals, and social ostracization.\
  \ Finally, we get into self-inflicted violence, and focus almost exclusively on\
  \ suicide and its many dimensions, also discussing depression and the problems with\
  \ psychopathological approaches to human behavior. We refer specifically to the\
  \ by-product theory of suicide as put forth by Cas Soper in his book, The Evolution\
  \ of Suicide.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:54  What is violence?  \n07:02  Violence is not\
