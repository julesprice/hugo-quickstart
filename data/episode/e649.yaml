shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 26th 2022.  \nDr. Bence Nanay is Professor of Philosophy\
  \ and BOF Research Professor at the University of Antwerp and has worked as a film\
  \ critic. He is co-director of the Centre for Philosophical Psychology at the University\
  \ of Antwerp. He is a cognitive scientist and philosopher of mind, working on perception,\
  \ attention, mental imagery and action. He also works on topics in aesthetics.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about philosophy of mind and cognitive science. We start\
  \ by discussing their relationship, and the role of experimental philosophy. We\
  \ then get into mental representations, what they are, and why cognitive science\
  \ needs them. We get deep into perception, what it is, how it works, how different\
  \ modes of perception influence one another, the relationship between cognition\
  \ and perception, the difference between perceptual content and mental imagery,\
  \ and how action influences perception.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:35 \
