shownotes: "Dr. Lee Ross is a Professor of Psychology at Stanford University and co-founder\
  \ of the Stanford Center on Conflict and Negotiation. He\u2019s been the recipient\
  \ of several awards. The author of three influential books, Human Inference and\
  \ the Person and the Situation (both with Richard Nisbett) and, more recently, The\
  \ Wisest One in the Room (with Thomas Gilovich), and many highly cited papers. His\
  \ research on attributional biases and shortcomings in human inference has exerted\
  \ a major impact in social psychology and the field of human inference, judgment\
  \ and decision-making. Among the phenomena he identified and has explored are the\
  \ fundamental attribution error, the false consensus effect, reactive devaluation,\
  \ the hostile media phenomenon, and the convictions of na\xEFve realism.   \nIn\
  \ this episode, we cover the psychological phenomena that were the main targets\
  \ of Dr. Ross\u2019 academic research. These include: the fundamental attribution\
  \ error; the just world phenomenon; cultural differences in how people apply the\
  \ fundamental attribution error; na\xEFve realism, the false consensus effect, and\
  \ objectivity in the eye of the beholder; reactive devaluation in the case of trying\
  \ to solve a problem between opposing human groups or political parties; and the\
  \ possible ways to get around these human cognitive inclinations.\n\nTime Links:\
