shownotes: "Dr. Jay Belsky is Robert and Natalie Read Dorne Professor of Human Development\
  \ in the Department of Human Ecology and Program in Human Development at the University\
  \ of California, Davis. Professor Belsky is an internationally recognized expert\
  \ in the field of child development and family studies. His areas of expertise include\
  \ the effects of day care, parent-child relations during the infancy and early childhood\
  \ years (including attachment), the transition to parenthood, the etiology of child\
  \ maltreatment and the evolutionary basis of parent and child functioning. Dr. Belsky's\
  \ research is marked by a focus upon fathers as well as mothers, marriages as well\
  \ as parent-child relations, and naturalistic home observations of family interaction\
  \ patterns. He is a founding and collaborating investigator on the NICHD Study of\
  \ Child Care and Youth Development (US) and The National Evaluation of Sure Start\
  \ (UK). He is the author of more than 300 scientific articles and chapters and the\
  \ author/editor of several books.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about childhood and\
  \ attachment theory. We start off by talking about the evolutionary and ecological\
  \ bases of parent-offspring relationships, including parent-offspring conflict,\
  \ and the different evolved strategies of attachment. We also discuss modern attachment\
  \ theory, and the main differences between it and classical attachment theory as\
  \ developed first by John Bowlby, how it relates to life history theory, and the\
  \ several different attachment styles that we have, including secure/autonomous,\
  \ avoidant/dismissing, resistant/preoccupied, and disorganized. In the second part\
  \ of the interview we also refer to parent-offspring conflict and child maltreatment;\
  \ the risks and benefits of daycare; and differential susceptibility in children\
  \ to different life circumstances during their development and different parenting\
  \ styles.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:22  The evolutionary bases of parent-offspring relationships\
