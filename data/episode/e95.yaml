  \ of Pennsylvania. His research focuses on the nature of evolved cognitive adaptations\

  \ Evolution & Human Behavior and President of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society.\
  \ He\u2019s also the author of the books Why Everyone (Else) Is a Hypocrite, and\
  \ The Hidden Agenda of the Political Mind. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about the\
  \ approach to the mind as being composed by a multitude of evolved cognitive modules\
  \ that helped us deal with problems during our evolutionary history. We go through\
  \ some of the main topics of both of Dr. Kurzban\u2019s books, and talk about how\
  \ our subconscious mind works and some of the implications of it, particularly about\
  \ a new perspective on phenomena like cognitive dissonance and self-deception. And\
  \ we also go through some of the implications that it has for politics.\n\nTime\
