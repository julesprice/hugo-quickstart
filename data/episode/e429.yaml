shownotes: '<p>Dr. Andrew Berry is a lecturer in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology.
  He is an evolutionary biologist with a particular interest in Alfred Russel Wallace.
  His research combined field and laboratory methods to detect positive Darwinian
  selection (i.e. adaptive evolution) at the molecular level in natural populations.
  He has published two books: Infinite tropics: an Alfred Russel Wallace Anthology,
  with a foreword written by Stephen Jay Gould, and DNA: The Secret of Life with James
  Watson.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about the history of evolutionary biology. We start
  with the early developments by Darwin and Wallace, and we also mention some precursors
  to evolutionary biology and even some early evolutionary biologists before Darwin
  and Wallace. We then get into Mendelian genetics, and the development of population
  genetics. Finally, we talk about the path that let to the development of the modern
  evolutionary synthesis in evolutionary biology.</p>
