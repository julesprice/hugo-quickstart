shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 1st 2020.  \nDr. Andrew Berry is a lecturer in Organismic\
  \ and Evolutionary Biology. He is an evolutionary biologist with a particular interest\
  \ in Alfred Russel Wallace. His research combined field and laboratory methods to\
  \ detect positive Darwinian selection (i.e. adaptive evolution) at the molecular\
  \ level in natural populations. He has published two books: Infinite tropics: an\
  \ Alfred Russel Wallace Anthology, with a foreword written by Stephen Jay Gould,\
  \ and DNA: The Secret of Life with James Watson.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ the history of evolutionary biology. We start with the early developments by Darwin\
  \ and Wallace, and we also mention some precursors to evolutionary biology and even\
  \ some early evolutionary biologists before Darwin and Wallace. We then get into\
  \ Mendelian genetics, and the development of population genetics. Finally, we talk\
  \ about the path that let to the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis\
  \ in evolutionary biology.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:49  Darwin, Wallace, and the early\
  \ days of the theory of evolution by natural selection  \n09:03  Could someone else\
