shownotes: "<p>Dr. April Bleske-Rechek is a Professor of Psychology at the University\
  \ of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. As a researcher, she focuses on human mating, friendship,\
  \ cognitive abilities and intellectual giftedness, and science literacy.</p>\n<p>In\
  \ this episode, we talk about a recent paper, \u201CGendered Perspectives on Sharing\
  \ the Load: Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Attitudes Toward Family Roles and Household\
  \ and Childcare Tasks\u201D. We first talk about where the evolutionary bases of\
  \ the human sexual division of labor. We go through some of the household and childcare\
  \ tasks men and women prefer. We talk about how the ways men and women share the\
  \ load changed since the 60s, and in what ways resource allocation might differ\
  \ between modern industrialized societies and traditional societies. We also spend\
  \ a lot of time discussing how evolved sex differences translate into occupational\
  \ and educational preferences, and why this is not a sign of sexism. Toward the\
  \ end we stress what evolutionary approaches to human behavior are really about\
  \ \u2013 describing behavior \u2013 and not about following any political, moral,\
  \ or ideological agenda, and why people should keep that in mind if they want to\
  \ understand social phenomena. We also discuss the trade-off women make between\
  \ family and career.</p>\n"
