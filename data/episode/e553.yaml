shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 12th 2021.  \nDr. April Bleske-Rechek is a Professor\
  \ of Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. As a researcher, she\
  \ focuses on human mating, friendship, cognitive abilities and intellectual giftedness,\
  \ and science literacy.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about a recent paper, \u201C\
  Gendered Perspectives on Sharing the Load: Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Attitudes\
  \ Toward Family Roles and Household and Childcare Tasks\u201D. We first talk about\
  \ where the evolutionary bases of the human sexual division of labor. We go through\
  \ some of the household and childcare tasks men and women prefer. We talk about\
  \ how the ways men and women share the load changed since the 60s, and in what ways\
  \ resource allocation might differ between modern industrialized societies and traditional\
  \ societies. We also spend a lot of time discussing how evolved sex differences\
  \ translate into occupational and educational preferences, and why this is not a\
  \ sign of sexism. Toward the end we stress what evolutionary approaches to human\
  \ behavior are really about \u2013 describing behavior \u2013 and not about following\
  \ any political, moral, or ideological agenda, and why people should keep that in\
  \ mind if they want to understand social phenomena. We also discuss the trade-off\
  \ women make between family and career.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:36\
