  of Sydney and director of the Sydney Centre for Language Research. His latest book
  is Language vs. Reality: Why Language Is Good for Lawyers and Bad for Scientists.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on Language vs. Reality. We talk about the premise
  of the book of language as both destroyer and creator. We discuss how language and
  reasoning are more about convincing people, rather than getting at the truth. We
  talk about perception and language as two steps of reduction of reality, and the
  idea of language as an interface for coordination. We discuss how different languages
  capture different aspects of reality. We get into psychological phenomena like priming
  and framing. We talk about framing in politics and the media. We discuss the idea
  of public discourse as a market for justifications, rather than a market for ideas.
  We go through the functions of stories. We discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Finally,
  we ask if we can know what are the best ways of talking about things.</p>
