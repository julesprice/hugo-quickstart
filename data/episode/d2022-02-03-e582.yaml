  \ State University. She received her Ph.D. from Yale University and writes primarily\
  \ in aesthetics and blogs at aestheticsforbirds.com. She is the author of Why It\u2019\
  s OK to Enjoy the Work of Immoral Artists.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on\
  \ Why It\u2019s OK to Enjoy the Work of Immoral Artists. We first discuss how aesthetic\
  \ questions might relate to ethical ones. We then ask if art can itself be immoral.\
  \ We discuss the complicated questions of how and when the work of an artist should\
  \ be condemned. We talk about the #meetoo movement, cancel culture, and the presumption\
  \ of guilt. We get into how people should feel about being influenced by immoral\
  \ artists. We discuss if it matters that people differ in their moral tastes. After\
  \ focusing on artists and consumers, we also mention platforms. Finally, we talk\
  \ about ethical consumption in other domains.</p>\n"
