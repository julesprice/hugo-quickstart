shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 13th 2022.  \nDr. Christopher von Rueden is Associate\
  \ Professor of Leadership Studies at the University of Richmond. An anthropologist\
  \ with expertise in traditional human societies, his research focuses on how humans\
  \ form status hierarchies, why we evolved to do so, and the demographic and ecological\
  \ factors that cause our hierarchies to be more or less coercive. Relatedly, he\
  \ studies the role of leader-follower relationships in the evolution of human cooperation.\
  \ In addition to his work on status and leadership, he has published on topics such\
  \ as why humans differ in personality traits and why we have such unique life histories\
  \ among primates.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about leadership and hierarchy. We\
  \ start with leadership from an evolutionary perspective. We talk about hierarchy\
  \ in human societies. We discuss how human form coalitions and maintain them. We\
  \ talk about the role of biology, culture, and ecology in the study of hierarchy\
  \ and leadership. We discuss leader-follower relationships. We talk about leadership\
  \ in small-scale egalitarian societies versus large-scale unequal societies. Finally,\
  \ we discuss sex differences in leadership.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:57\
