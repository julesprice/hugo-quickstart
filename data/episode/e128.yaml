shownotes: "Dr. Randy Thornhill is an American entomologist and evolutionary biologist.\
  \ He is a professor of biology at the University of New Mexico, and was president\
  \ of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society from 2011 to 2013. He is known for\
  \ his evolutionary explanation of rape as well as his work on insect mating systems\
  \ and the parasite-stress theory. He\u2019s the author of several books, including\
  \ A Natural History of Rape, and The Parasite-Stress Theory of Values and Sociality.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on the main topics of Dr. Thornhill\u2019s book, The\
  \ Parasite-Stress Theory of Values and Sociality (https://tinyurl.com/ybuant6k).\
  \ We explore the evolutionary bases of the behavioral immune system, and the strategies\
  \ humans and other animals evolved, in terms of sociality, to avoid getting in contact\
  \ with sources of infection and contamination. In the case of humans, these strategies\
  \ involve politics, culture, society, personality, and other aspects. We also refer\
  \ to the biological bases of culture; the emotions of disgust and fear; the cultural\
  \ differences between the southern and the northern United States; religious content\
  \ to do with purity and pathogen avoidance; how parasite-stress might have affected\
  \ the development of the Inquisition, the Enlightenment, and the 60\u2019s Cultural\
  \ Revolution; and also how it is a factor that contributes to speciation.\n\nTime\
