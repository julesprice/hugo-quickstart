  . Pearce calls this the \"abolitionist project\".</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk\
  \ about transhumanism, the hedonistic imperative, and the abolitionist project.\
  \ We first get into concepts like negative utilitarianism, hedonism, and gradients\
  \ of bliss. We discuss the goals of the abolitionist project, and the living beings\
  \ it would target. We talk about the different technological approaches to abolishing\
  \ suffering, like pharmacology, genetic engineering, nanotechnology, neurosurgery,\
  \ becoming cyborgs, Nozick\u2019s experience machine, and immortality. We discuss\
  \ to what extent these technologies are sufficiently well-developed, or if we would\
  \ need to wait more time. We discuss why social, economic, and political reforms\
  \ are not enough. We tackle questions regarding how our human experience would change.\
  \ We discuss how we should deal with people who would prefer to opt out of the abolitionist\
  \ project. Finally, we ask if we have less suffering in the world nowadays.</p>\n"
