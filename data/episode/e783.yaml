shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 18th 2022.  \nDr. Kevin Dorst is an Assistant Professor\
  \ in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT. He works on epistemology,\
  \ logic, language, and their intersections.  In epistemology he\u2019s interested\
  \ in what we should think (the belief-credence connection), why we should think\
  \ it (foundations), and how we should think about what we should think (higher-order\
  \ uncertainty).  In logic, he\u2019s interested in various models of these things;\
  \ in language, he\u2019s interested the semantics of various statements about them.\
  \ More recently, he\u2019s been thinking about the connection between epistemology\
  \ and cognitive science and psychology\u2014and, in particular, how our idealized\
  \ models and theories of rationality can help inform our understanding of our non-ideal\
  \ selves.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about epistemology. We go through topics like:\
  \ the questions epistemology deals with; what a belief is; the distinction between\
  \ beliefs, assertions, and guesses; justified beliefs; higher-order evidence, and\
  \ higher-order uncertainty; epistemic modesty; and when to defer to experts.\n\n\
