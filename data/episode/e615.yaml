shownotes: '<p>Dr. Mark W. Moffett is a tropical biologist and research associate
  at the Smithsonian and used to be a visiting scholar in the Department of Human
  Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University, which he used to write his book, The
  Human Swarm: How Our Societies Arise, Thrive, and Fall.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on The Human Swarm. We go through topics like: what
  is a society; what makes humans successful; different types of hunter-gatherer societies;
  how societies scale up; markers of membership; how people think about societies;
  identities, and how they change over time; the lifecycle of societies, including
  how they end; war and peace across human history; transfers of membership, slavery
  and subjugation; immigration, and how citizenship is determined; and the necessity
  of societies.</p>
