shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 19th 2020.  \nDr. Stefaan Blancke is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Philosophy at Tilburg University, Netherlands. He studies the diffusion of\
  \ (pseudo)scientific beliefs from an epidemiological perspective. His research focuses\
  \ on the psychological and environmental factors that shape and constrain the development\
  \ and distribution of these beliefs in the history and philosophy of science, science\
  \ education and the public understanding of science. He is also interested in the\
  \ philosophy of cultural evolution and the role of reasons in cultural phenomena\
  \ such as science, morality and the self.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about philosophy\
  \ of science. We focus on the demarcation problem, the scientific method, and how\
  \ to distinguish science from pseudoscience. We also talk about the evolutionary\
  \ bases of pseudoscience, and how cultural attraction theory applies to the diffusion\
  \ of pseudoscientific and scientific beliefs. We discuss if evolutionary psychology\
  \ is really a science. Finally, we talk a little bit about selves as cultural attractors.\n\
