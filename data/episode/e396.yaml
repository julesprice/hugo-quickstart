shownotes: "<p>Dr. Jeff McMahan is White\u2019s Professor of Moral Philosophy at the\
  \ University of Oxford. He specializes in Practical Ethics, Political Philosophy,\
  \ and Ethics. He\u2019s the author of books like The Morality of Nationalism, The\
  \ Ethics of Killing: Problems at the Margins of Life, and Killing in War.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we focus on the killing in war, and the ethics of vegetarianism/veganism.\
  \ About killing in ward, we address questions like what is a just and an unjust\
  \ war, the circumstances where soldiers are morally justified to kill other soldiers,\
  \ excusable conditions for participating in war, when civilians might be liable\
  \ to being targeted by soldiers, coercion, and teaching moral philosophy to soldiers.\
  \ In the second part, we discuss the ethics of vegetarianism, and we go through\
  \ different objections to it, like the pleasure we derive from eating meat, the\
  \ possibility of the extinction of farm animals, and raising animals in a humane\
  \ way. We also talk about eating already dead animals, cannibalism, and lab-grown\
  \ meat.</p>\n"
