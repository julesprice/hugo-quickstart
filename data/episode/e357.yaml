shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 10th, 2020.  \nDr. Elliott Sober is Hans Reichenbach\
  \ Professor and William F. Vilas Research Professor in the Department of Philosophy\
  \ at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. Dr. Sober is noted for his work in\
  \ philosophy of biology and general philosophy of science. He\u2019s the author\
  \ of books like Philosophy of Biology, Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology\
  \ of Unselfish Behavior, and The Design Argument.\n\nIn this episode, we focus our\
  \ conversation on the topic of group selection. We establish the kinds of behavior\
  \ that group selectin allows for us to have a better grasp on, particularly altruistic\
  \ behavior. Then we talk about the limitations of a gene-centered approach to natural\
  \ selection; how people (wrongly) think about evolution; and the averaging fallacy.\
  \ We also discuss the role of rewards and punishments in the evolution of altruism,\
  \ and the development of social norms. Finally, we talk about how multilevel selection\
  \ works, and the extended evolutionary synthesis.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:47  What\
