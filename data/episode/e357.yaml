shownotes: "<p>Dr. Elliott Sober is Hans Reichenbach Professor and William F. Vilas\
  \ Research Professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin\u2013\
  Madison. Dr. Sober is noted for his work in philosophy of biology and general philosophy\
  \ of science. He\u2019s the author of books like Philosophy of Biology, Unto Others:\
  \ The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior, and The Design Argument.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we focus our conversation on the topic of group selection. We\
  \ establish the kinds of behavior that group selectin allows for us to have a better\
  \ grasp on, particularly altruistic behavior. Then we talk about the limitations\
  \ of a gene-centered approach to natural selection; how people (wrongly) think about\
  \ evolution; and the averaging fallacy. We also discuss the role of rewards and\
  \ punishments in the evolution of altruism, and the development of social norms.\
  \ Finally, we talk about how multilevel selection works, and the extended evolutionary\
  \ synthesis.</p>\n"
