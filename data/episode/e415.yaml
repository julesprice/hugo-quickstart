  \ Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Cambridge.\

  \ An Introduction to Philosophy of Medicine, and he is currently writing a book\
  \ on the sciences of sexual desire.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about philosophy\
  \ of medicine. We first discuss what is philosophy of medicine, and then go through\
  \ some of the major questions asked by philosophers of the discipline, like what\
  \ is evidence, what is effectiveness, and what is a disease. We also talk about\
  \ sources of evidence, like randomized control trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses,\
  \ and we mention the plurality of reasoning strategies appealed to by the epidemiologist\
  \ Sir Bradford Hill. Finally, we discuss what is medical nihilism, and we Dr. Stegenga\
  \ gives us a short teaser to his next book, focused on the sciences of sexual desire.\n\
