  \ 2010),The Natural and the Human (Oxford, 2016), Civilization and the Culture of\

  The Uniqueness of the West: Classical Antiquity, the Orient, and the Construction\
  \ of a European Cultural Identity, 1550-1914\u2019. His new book is The Failures\
  \ of Philosophy: A Historical Essay. \n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Failures\
  \ of Philosophy. We first discuss what Dr. Gaukroger means by failures in Philosophy\
  \ in his book. We ask what philosophy is, and what we can learn about it by studying\
  \ how it failed. We get into some of the history of philosophy, from Plato to the\
  \ natural philosophers. Finally, we discuss the current status of philosophy, how\
  \ it relates to science, and its possible future.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro\
