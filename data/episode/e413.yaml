shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 23rd 2020.  \nDr. Michael Anderson is Rotman Canada\
  \ Research Chair in Philosophy of Science, Core member at the Rotman Institute of\
  \ Philosophy, and Core member at the Brain and Mind Institute at the University\
  \ of Western Ontario. For 2012-13, Dr. Anderson is a Fellow at the Center for Advanced\
  \ Study in the Behavioral Sciences, at Stanford University. His primary areas of\
  \ research include an account of the evolution of the cortex via exaptation of existing\
  \ neural circuitry (the \"massive redeployment hypothesis\"); the role of behavior,\
  \ and of the brain's motor-control areas, in supporting higher-order cognitive functions;\
  \ the foundations of intentionality (the connection between objects of thought and\
  \ things in the world); and the role of self-monitoring and self-control in maintaining\
  \ robust real-world agency.\n\nIn this episode, we talk neuroscience and cognitive\
  \ science. We start with the evolution of the brain, and what is the best way to\
  \ understand it, and go through the modularity approach, the idea of functional\
  \ localization, and the triune brain model. We then move into mechanisms like neuromodulation,\
  \ neuroplasticity, response to damage, and neural regeneration. We talk about Dr.\
  \ Anderson\u2019s massive redeployment (or reuse) hypothesis of brain evolution.\
  \ Finally, we talk about how important interdisciplinarity is to studying the brain.\n\
