shownotes: "<p>Dr. Henkjan Honing is professor in Music Cognition at both the Faculty\
  \ of Humanities and the Faculty of Science of the University of Amsterdam (UvA).\
  \ He conducts his research under the auspices of the Institute for Logic, Language\
  \ and Computation (ILLC) and the University of Amsterdam's Brain and Cognition (ABC)\
  \ Center. Dr. Honing is known as a passionate researcher in this new interdisciplinary\
  \ field that gives us fundamental insights in the cognitive mechanisms underlying\
  \ musicality. He published several books, including Music Cognition: The Basics\
  \ (2021, Routledge), The Evolving Animal Orchestra: In Search of What Makes Us Musical\
  \ (2019, The MIT Press)\u2013, and an edited volume with a research agenda on musicality\
  \ entitled The Origins of Musicality (2018, The MIT Press).</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we talk about musicality. We start with its cognitive components, and then go\
  \ through: musicality in other animals; the relationship between musicality and\
  \ language; the evolutionary functions of music; synchrony and social bonding; human\
  \ universals in music; the neuroscience of music; sexual selection; and if other\
  \ animals appreciate music.</p>\n"
