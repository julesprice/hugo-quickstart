shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 9th 2021.  \nDr. Brian Knutson is a Professor of\
  \ Psychology and Neuroscience at Stanford University. His research focuses on the\
  \ neural basis of emotional experience and expression. His long-term goal is to\
  \ understand the neurochemical and neuroanatomical mechanisms responsible for emotional\
  \ experience, and to explore the implications of these findings for the assessment\
  \ and treatment of clinical disorders as well as for economic behavior. He is a\
  \ fellow of the Academy for Behavioral Medicine Research and the Association for\
  \ Psychological Science, and his research has been funded by the National Science\
  \ Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and numerous private foundations.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about affective neuroscience. We start by discussing\
  \ what it is, and the kinds of questions it deals with. We talk about affect, emotions,\
  \ and what they correspond to in the brain. We discuss if is makes sense to distinguish\
  \ between emotions and feelings. We talk about the areas in the brain that play\
  \ a role in emotion processing. We discuss the role emotions play in decision-making.\
  \ We talk about how affect influences preferences and beliefs. We ask if emotions\
  \ vary cross-culturally. We then get into aspects related to financial decisions,\
  \ including the relationship between future self-continuity and savings, financial\
  \ risk-taking, and gain and loss learning. We discuss if there are individual differences\
  \ in these domains, and if economic decisions vary across the lifespan. Finally,\
  \ we talk about what neuroscience adds to the picture of psychology and economics.\n\
