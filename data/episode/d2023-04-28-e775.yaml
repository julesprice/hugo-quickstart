shownotes: '<p>Dr. Charles Fernyhough is a Professor of Psychology at Durham University,
  and Director of the Centre for Research into Inner Experience. He has contributed
  to the understanding of how language and thought are related in child development
  and beyond. The focus of his recent scientific work has been in applying ideas from
  mainstream developmental psychology to the study of psychosis, particularly the
  phenomenon of voice-hearing.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about inner speech, imaginary companions, and hallucinations.
  We start with inner speech, how it develops in children, its connection to language,
  its functions, its neuroscience, and rumination. We then talk about imaginary companions,
  why children have them, how they influence how they think about their real-life
  friends, and their link to inner speech. We also discuss auditory verbal hallucinations,
  their neuroscience (with a focus on resting state networks and the default mode
  network); how people sometimes personalize the voices they hear; musical hallucinations;
  and multimodal hallucinations. Finally, we discuss how to think about distinguishing
  clinical from non-clinical conditions.</p>
