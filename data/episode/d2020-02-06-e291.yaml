shownotes: "<p>Dr. Nicholas Stang is Associate Professor in the Philosophy Department\
  \ of the University of Toronto, and also a Humboldt Research Fellow at the Humboldt\
  \ University in Berlin. His primary research interests are metaphysics and its history\
  \ (mainly in German philosophy). His first book, Kant\u2019s Modal Metaphysics,\
  \ was published by Oxford University Press in 2016. While most of Dr. Stang\u2019\
  s published work has been about Kant, he is increasingly interested in pre-Kantian\
  \ rationalism (Leibniz, Spinoza) and in post-Kantian figures, especially Hegel and\
  \ Heidegger. He also works on contemporary metaphysics and aesthetics. His side\
  \ interests include: Jewish philosophy, early analytic philosophy, philosophy of\
  \ mathematics, and critical theory.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Kantian\
  \ philosophy, particularly on his metaphysics, epistemology and ethics. We start\
  \ by presenting what metaphysics is, and the sorts of questions it deals with. We\
  \ also talk about hos modern metaphysics positions itself in relation to science\
  \ and Physics, referring on the way to the epistemological limits of a materialist\
  \ approach. Then we get into Kant\u2019s metaphysics, and explore concepts like\
  \ the noumenon and the phenomenon. After that, we move to his epistemology, and\
  \ discuss sensibility, the categories of understanding, and pure Reason with its\
  \ antinomies. Finally, we go through Kantian ethics, and the necessity of a God,\
  \ a soul and free will. We also address the metaphysical status of moral laws, and\
  \ the is-ought gap from a Kantian perspective.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Stang\u2019\
