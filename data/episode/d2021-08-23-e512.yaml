shownotes: "<p>Dr. Sander van der Linden is Professor of Social Psychology in the\
  \ Department of Psychology at the University of Cambridge and Director of the Cambridge\
  \ Social Decision-Making Lab. His research interests center around the psychology\
  \ of human judgment, communication, and decision-making, including social norms\
  \ and networks, attitudes and polarization, reasoning about evidence, and the public\
  \ understanding of risk and uncertainty.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about\
  \ social media, fake news, and science communication and denial. We first get into\
  \ several aspects of social media interactions, like how they change how people\
  \ communicate; in what ways they resemble real-life interactions; the phenomenon\
  \ of eco chambers, and political polarization; and fake news and misinformation.\
  \ We talk specifically about the motivations behind the sharing of fake news. We\
  \ then discuss the best ways of doing evidence and science communication, and also\
  \ the idea of inoculating people against misinformation. We go into science denial\
  \ and the politicization of facts, and how to deal with these phenomena. We dive\
  \ into misinformation in the context of the covid-19 pandemic, and what governments\
  \ and health authorities could have done better in communicating about it. Finally,\
  \ we ask if social media represent a net positive or a net negative in people\u2019\
  s lives.</p>\n"
