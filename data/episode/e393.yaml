shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 10th 2020.  \nDr. Paul Bloom is the Brooks and Suzanne\
  \ Ragen Professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University. His research\
  \ explores how children and adults understand the physical and social world, with\
  \ special focus on language, morality, religion, fiction, and art. He is the author\
  \ of books like How Children Learn the Meanings of Words (2000), How Pleasure Works:\
  \ The New Science of Why We Like What We Like (2010), Just Babies: The Origins of\
  \ Good and Evil (2013), and Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion (2016).\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about human nature and empathy. We start with a bit of\
  \ developmental psychology, and discuss how we study babies, and how good they really\
  \ are as models for human nature and the innateness of behavior. We also deal with\
  \ mind-body dualism, and how people think about the physical world and the social\
  \ world differently. We then get into moral development. We also talk about Against\
  \ Empathy, the distinction between emotional and cognitive empathy, compassion,\
  \ and psychopathy. We tackle the link between morality and violence, and we talk\
  \ a little bit about dehumanization. Finally, Dr. Bloom lifts the veil on his upcoming\
  \ book, about pleasure and/in pain.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:44  Studying baby behavior\
