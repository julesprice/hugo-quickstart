  \ Distinguished Service Professor in the departments of Psychology and Ecology &\
  \ Evolutionary Biology at the University of Tennessee. His research focus has been\
  \ on comparative studies of behavioral development in animals with special attention\
  \ to reptiles, bears, and the evolution of play, as well as historical and theoretical\
  \ issues in ethology and psychology. He has served as editor or editorial board\
  \ member of numerous journals and is past president of the Animal Behavior Society\
  \ and the Society for Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology (APA Div.\
  \ 6). He has edited or co-edited 6 books and authored The Genesis of Animal Play:\
  \ Testing the Limits (MIT Press, 2005).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the evolution\
  \ of play. First, we define play from a biological perspective, including five different\
  \ criteria for a particular behavior to be classified as play. We talk about the\
  \ three different categories of play (locomotor, object, and social). We also discuss\
  \ play signals, role reversals, self-handicapping, the diversity of play, its downsides\
  \ and costs, pseudo-copulatory play in spiders, and the surplus resources theory.\
  \ Finally, We address of question of play possibly being behind certain elements\
  \ of human culture, like rituals and religion.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:51  What is\
