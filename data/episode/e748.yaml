shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 24th 2022.  \nDr. Tereza Capelos is Associate Professor\
  \ in Political Psychology at the University of Birmingham, Director of the Institute\
  \ for Conflict Cooperation and Security, and past President of the International\
  \ Society of Political Psychology (ISPP). Her research focuses on the affective,\
  \ cognitive and motivational determinants of political judgments. She is particularly\
  \ interested in the role of emotions and values on political radicalization and\
  \ tolerance, the formation and updating of institutional and individual reputations\
  \ and the role of trust and confidence on political accountability attributions.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about topics in political psychology. We start with the\
  \ mechanism of ressentiment, its relationship with anger, and how it manifests itself\
  \ in politics, including populism. We talk about Brexit, and how affectivity is\
  \ exploited in political campaigns. Finally, we talk about the role of trust in\
  \ politics and society, and how institutional reputations are formed and updated.\n\
