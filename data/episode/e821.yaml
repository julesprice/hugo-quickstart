shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 21st 2023.  \nRebecka Hahnel-Peeters is a PhD student\
  \ studying human behavior from an adaptationist perspective in the Evolutionary\
  \ Psychology Lab at the University of Texas at Austin with Dr. David Buss. She joined\
  \ the Buss Lab after finishing her MA Degree at California State University, Fullerton\
  \ in Spring 2021. In her Master's thesis, she sought to understand individual differences\
  \ in rape myth acceptance. She is currently interested in sexual conflict and women's\
  \ psychological adaptations against sexual exploitation.\n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ talk about rape myth acceptance, strategies against sexual exploitation, and the\
  \ relationship between evolutionary psychology and evolutionary anthropology. We\
  \ start by discussing rape myth acceptance; some common rape myths; the Rape Excusing\
  \ Attitudes and Language Scale; the reproductive self-interest model of morality\
  \ (RSIMM) as a framework for understanding moral judgments associated with sexual\
  \ behavior; individual differences in attitudes toward abortion, prostitution, and\
  \ contraception; and what predicts rape myth acceptance. We then talk about female\
  \ psychological adaptations against sexual exploitation. Finally, we discuss the\
  \ relationship between evolutionary psychology and evolutionary anthropology.\n\n\
