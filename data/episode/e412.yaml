shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 23rd 2020.  \nDr. Agner Fog is associate professor\
  \ of computer science at Technical University of Denmark. Dr. Fog does research\
  \ in Evolutionary Anthropology, Cultural Anthropology, Social systems and Computer\
  \ Science. His current project is 'Theory of cultural change based on evolutionary\
  \ psychology, evolutionary biology, and cultural evolution.' He\u2019s the author\
  \ of \u201CWarlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture\u201D\
  , and \u201CCultural Selection\u201D. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about cultural\
  \ evolution. We start by comparing cultural evolution to biological evolution, and\
  \ we then discuss memetics extensively. We talk about how science works from a cultural\
  \ evolutionary perspective, the differences between genes and memes, and types of\
  \ selection that cannot be expressed as memes. We get into media, social media,\
  \ and fake news; and politics, and the power of money. We ask if cultural evolution\
  \ is intelligent, how we can explain differing levels of conflict between societies,\
  \ and how the environment influences social organization. We also go through the\
  \ cultural evolution of different kinds of religion (animism, polytheism, and monotheism),\
  \ and we ask if cultural evolution moves linearly, and if we still have empires.\n\
