shownotes: "<p>Dr. Agner Fog is associate professor of computer science at Technical\
  \ University of Denmark. Dr. Fog does research in Evolutionary Anthropology, Cultural\
  \ Anthropology, Social systems and Computer Science. His current project is 'Theory\
  \ of cultural change based on evolutionary psychology, evolutionary biology, and\
  \ cultural evolution.' He\u2019s the author of \u201CWarlike and Peaceful Societies:\
  \ The Interaction of Genes and Culture\u201D, and \u201CCultural Selection\u201D\
  .</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about cultural evolution. We start by comparing\
  \ cultural evolution to biological evolution, and we then discuss memetics extensively.\
  \ We talk about how science works from a cultural evolutionary perspective, the\
  \ differences between genes and memes, and types of selection that cannot be expressed\
  \ as memes. We get into media, social media, and fake news; and politics, and the\
  \ power of money. We ask if cultural evolution is intelligent, how we can explain\
  \ differing levels of conflict between societies, and how the environment influences\
  \ social organization. We also go through the cultural evolution of different kinds\
  \ of religion (animism, polytheism, and monotheism), and we ask if cultural evolution\
  \ moves linearly, and if we still have empires.</p>\n"
