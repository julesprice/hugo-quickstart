  <p>In this episode, we focus on The Fall of the University of Cape Town. Dr. Benatar\
  \ gives us a brief overview of how the decline at UCT started, how it was dealt\
  \ with, and the demands made by the students. We talk about terms like \u201Ctransformation\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cdecolonization\u201D of the curricula. We discuss the role of university,\
  \ and academic freedom. We talk about racial issues in South Africa, affirmative\
  \ action, cancel culture, and identity politics. Finally, we ask if there are any\
  \ good solutions to what is happening at UCT.</p>\n"
