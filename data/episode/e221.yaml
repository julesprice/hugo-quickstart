shownotes: "Dr. Peter DeScioli is Assistant Professor in the Department of Political\
  \ Science at Stony Brook University. His research investigates how the human mind\
  \ uses principles of strategy to solve problems in the social world. Much of his\
  \ work has focused on moral condemnation, especially the functions of morally judging\
  \ other people, moralistic punishment, and moral impartiality. In another line of\
  \ work, he studies how people form alliances, how they choose their loyalties to\
  \ others, and how they display and conceal their loyalties. A third project looks\
  \ at our sense of ownership by using a virtual environment to observe resource disputes\
  \ in the laboratory. In recent years, he has been designing online games for experiments\
  \ about politics, including redistribution of wealth, social safety nets, alliance\
  \ formation, and political negotiation.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the evolution\
  \ of (human) morality, and several of its features, mostly based on a presentation\
  \ by Dr. DeScioli. First, he tells us about some of the basics on the evolutionary\
  \ psychology of morality. We talk specifically about evolved algorithms of the mind\
  \ and moral modules. We then get into how we go from moral intuitions to explicit\
  \ moral rules, and the role of culture. After that, we discuss moral judgment and\
  \ the side-taking hypothesis, as well as some of the moral mysteries that it solves.\
  \ Finally, we discuss the psychology of coordination and common knowledge.\n\nTime\
