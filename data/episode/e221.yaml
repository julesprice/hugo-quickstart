  \ presentation by Dr. DeScioli. First, he tells us about some of the basics on the\
  \ evolutionary psychology of morality. We talk specifically about evolved algorithms\
  \ of the mind and moral modules. We then get into how we go from moral intuitions\
  \ to explicit moral rules, and the role of culture. After that, we discuss moral\
  \ judgment and the side-taking hypothesis, as well as some of the moral mysteries\
  \ that it solves. Finally, we discuss the psychology of coordination and common\
  \ knowledge.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. DeScioli\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty\

  Science at Stony Brook University. His research investigates how the human mind
  uses principles of strategy to solve problems in the social world. Much of his work
  has focused on moral condemnation, especially the functions of morally judging other
  people, moralistic punishment, and moral impartiality. In another line of work,
  he studies how people form alliances, how they choose their loyalties to others,
  and how they display and conceal their loyalties. A third project looks at our sense
