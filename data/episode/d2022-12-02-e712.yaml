shownotes: '<p>Dr. Lionel Page is a Professor of Economics and Director of the Behavioural
  and Economic Science Cluster at the University of Queensland. He is interested in
  understanding how people make decisions, alone or in groups. He is the author of
  Optimally Irrational: The Good Reasons We Behave the Way We Do.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on Optimally Irrational. We start by discussing what
  it means to be optimally irrational, and how rationality has been traditionally
  studied in economics. We talk about biases, replacing the H. economicus model, and
  adding an evolutionary lens to human behavior. We then go through some psychological
  phenomena, including rules of thumb and gut feelings; reference-dependence and loss
  aversion; overweighting the probabilities of extreme outcomes; preferences; kindness
  and reciprocity; emotions; commitment; social identity; indirect speech, ambiguity
  and innuendos; and overconfidence and self-deception. Finally, we discuss what rationality
  is.</p>
