  \nIn this episode, we talk about standardized testing. We first talk about gifted\
  \ students, and the Advanced Placement program in the US and Canada. We then discuss\
  \ standardized tests, test bias, and the predictive validity of IQ tests. Finally,\
  \ we ask if critical thinking and creativity is something useful to teach in schools,\
  \ and how it should be taught.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:58  Gifted students  \n09:36\
