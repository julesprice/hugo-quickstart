shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 24th 2021.  \nDr. Brian Leiter is Karl N. Llewellyn\
  \ Professor of Jurisprudence at the University of Chicago Law School and founder\
  \ and Director of Chicago's Center for Law, Philosophy and Human Values. His teaching\
  \ and research interests are in moral, political, and legal philosophy, in both\
  \ the Anglophone and Continental European traditions, and the law of evidence. He\
  \ is the author of books like Nietzsche on Morality, Naturalizing Jurisprudence,\
  \ Why Tolerate Religion? and, more recently, Moral Psychology with Nietzsche.\n\n\
  In this episode, we talk about Moral Psychology with Nietzsche. First, Dr. Leiter\
  \ tells us what got him interested in Nietzsche. We then ask if Nietzsche was a\
  \ moral realist, and where he thought morality comes from. We discuss Nietzsche\u2019\
  s ideas about nature and nurture in moral psychology. We get into concepts like\
  \ \u201Cdrives\u201D, \u201Caffect\u201D, and the \u201CWill\u201D. We talk about\
  \ the role of personality and individual differences in moral predispositions. We\
  \ discuss to what extent consciousness has any sort of causal power over our behavior.\
  \ We talk about Nietzsche\u2019s \u201Cdeath of God\u201D and atheism. We discuss\
  \ if there is any space for moral revaluation in Nietzsche\u2019s moral philosophy,\
  \ and if \u201Cmoral progress\u201D would make sense for him. We talk about the\
  \ main Nietzschean insights on moral psychology that got vindicated by modern scientific\
  \ psychology. Finally, we discuss if Nietzsche was an Enlightenment thinker.\n\n\
