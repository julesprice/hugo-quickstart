  \ for Law, Philosophy and Human Values. He is the author of books like Nietzsche\
  \ on Morality, Naturalizing Jurisprudence, Why Tolerate Religion? and, more recently,\
  \ Moral Psychology with Nietzsche.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about Moral\
  \ Psychology with Nietzsche. First, Dr. Leiter tells us what got him interested\
  \ in Nietzsche. We then ask if Nietzsche was a moral realist, and where he thought\
  \ morality comes from. We discuss Nietzsche\u2019s ideas about nature and nurture\
  \ in moral psychology. We get into concepts like \u201Cdrives\u201D, \u201Caffect\u201D\
  , and the \u201CWill\u201D. We talk about the role of personality and individual\
  \ differences in moral predispositions. We discuss to what extent consciousness\
  \ has any sort of causal power over our behavior. We talk about Nietzsche\u2019\
  s \u201Cdeath of God\u201D and atheism. We discuss if there is any space for moral\
  \ revaluation in Nietzsche\u2019s moral philosophy, and if \u201Cmoral progress\u201D\
  \ would make sense for him. We talk about the main Nietzschean insights on moral\
  \ psychology that got vindicated by modern scientific psychology. Finally, we discuss\
  \ if Nietzsche was an Enlightenment thinker.</p>\n"
