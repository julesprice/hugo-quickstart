  <p>Dr. Robert McCauley is the William Rand Kenan Jr. University Professor of Philosophy\
  \ at the Center for Mind, Brain, and Culture, at Emory University.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dr.\
  \ George Graham is former Professor of Philosophy at the University of Alabama at\
  \ Birmingham and Georgia State University, and the AC Reid Professor of Philosophy\
  \ at Wake Forest University.</p>\n<p>They are both authors of a recent book, Hearing\
  \ Voices and Other Matters of the Mind: What Mental Abnormalities Can Teach Us About\
  \ Religions.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on their book. We start by covering\
  \ some of the concepts that they explore in the book, like ecumenical naturalism\
  \ and purpose-driven continuity theory. We talk about the continuity between religious\
  \ cognition, normal cognition and mental disorders, and what happens when mental\
  \ disorders manifest in a religious context. We also discuss mental disorders more\
  \ generally, and ask if they are illnesses, and if they are cultural. We tackle\
  \ the issue of by-product, adaptation, and cultural group selection approaches to\
  \ religion. We then go through the mental disorders covered in the book. We start\
  \ with a condition that is also experienced by normal people: hallucinatory voices.\
  \ We then talk about depression, Obsessive-compulsive disorder, and autism. Finally,\
  \ we discuss if we really need to study people\u2019s beliefs to understand religious\
  \ phenomena, and end with how the framework laid-out in the book can be applied\
  \ to studying terrorism, and in a clinical context.</p>\n"
