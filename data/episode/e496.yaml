  \ Vital Statistics that Explain World History.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Figuring\
  \ Out The Past. We start by discussing some possible limitations of (narrative)\
  \ History, and what SHESHAT\u2019s approach has to offer. We talk about many different\
  \ kinds of patterns we find across societies and across time, and how societies\
  \ are similar but also differ from one another. We discuss cultural evolution, how\
  \ it works in different domains, and things like rates of innovation. We ask why\
  \ societies rise and fall. We discuss the role religion plays in society. We also\
  \ talk about how to make sense of some of the statistics presented in the book,\
  \ particularly the ones related to standing armies, collective rituals, monuments,\
  \ and cultural tools like calendars, law codes, and bureaucracy. Finally, we ask\
  \ if it is possible to use these date to understand contemporary events and to predict\
  \ future events.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:48  An integrative approach\
