shownotes: "<p>Dr. Itai Yanai is Founding Director of the Institute for Computational\
  \ Medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. He is also a Professor in the\
  \ Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at NYU. He does research\
  \ on cancer, computational biology, developmental genetics, genomics, microbiome,\
  \ systems biology, single-cell transcriptomics, gene expression atlas construction,\
  \ genome evolution. He is the author of The Society of Genes.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we focus on The Society of Genes. We first talk about the metaphor of the \u201C\
  selfish gene\u201D. We ask if mutations really occur randomly. We get into the idea\
  \ of \u201Cthe society of genes\u201D, and discuss how genes cooperate and compete\
  \ with one another. We discuss pleiotropy and polygenic traits, and what they tell\
  \ us about how genes work. We talk about the evolution of sex, and what we can learn\
  \ about genetics by studying cancer. We discuss human genetic diversity, and how\
  \ to deal with genetic ancestry in medicine. Finally, we talk about epigenetics,\
  \ gene editing, and some unanswered questions in genetics.</p>\n"
