shownotes: "<p>Dr. Stephen Law is formally Reader in Philosophy at Heythrop College,\
  \ and before that Research Fellow at The Queen\u2019s College Oxford. He is currently\
  \ editor of the Royal Institute of Philosophy journal THINK. He has published several\
  \ books, including The Philosophy Gym, A Very Short Introduction to Humanism, and\
  \ Believing Bullshit. He is a Fellow of The Royal Society of Arts and Commerce and\
  \ in 2008 became the provost of the Centre for Inquiry UK.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we start off by talking about the limitations of naturalism in terms\
  \ of knowledge acquisition, the is-ought problem, and the flaws of relativism. Then,\
  \ we move on to discussing Liberalism, as is presented by Stephen Law in his book,\
  \ The War for Children\u2019s Minds, and the important distinction between freedom\
  \ of thought and freedom of action. We also deal with the issue of religion in a\
  \ scientific world and the approach of the New Atheists. We question the idea that\
  \ the West is going through some sort of \u201Cmoral crisis\u201D, and the bad outcomes\
  \ that pushing for that narrative might have. And, finally, we address the flaws\
  \ in arguments between religious people and atheist when it comes to the problem\
  \ of evil and the Evil-God challenge.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:54\
