shownotes: "Dr. Patrick McNamara is an Associate Professor of Neurology in the Department\
  \ of Neurology at the BU School of Medicine and Professor of Psychology at National\
  \ University, and Director of the Cognitive Neuroscience of Religion Project, along\
  \ with Dr. Jordan Grafman. Upon graduating from the Behavioral Neuroscience Program\
  \ at Boston University in 1991, he trained at the Aphasia Research Center at the\
  \ Boston VA Medical Center in neurolinguistics and brain-cognitive correlation techniques.\
  \ He then began developing an evolutionary approach to problems of brain and behavior\
  \ and currently is studying the evolution of the frontal lobes, the evolution of\
  \ the two mammalian sleep states (REM and NREM) and the evolution of religion in\
  \ human cultures. He is the author of The Cognitive Neuroscience of Religious Experience:\
  \ Decentering and the Self.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Cognitive Neuroscience\
  \ of Religious Experience. We start by talking about the use of neuroscience in\
  \ the study of religion, the evolution of religion, its role in gene-culture coevolution,\
  \ and religion as a transformational technology. We then go through decentering,\
  \ the divided self, the cognitive mechanisms and brain conditions that give rise\
  \ to religiosity, psychedelics, mystical experiences, supernatural agents, rituals,\
  \ and the relationship between language and religion.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
