shownotes: "<p>Dr. Justin Tosi is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Texas Tech\
  \ University. He works in social, political, legal, and moral philosophy, and especially\
  \ on state legitimacy, special obligations, and social morality. He\u2019s the author\
  \ of Grandstanding: The Use and Abuse of Moral Talk (co-authored with Brandon Warmke).</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about Grandstanding. We define grandstanding, and the\
  \ different types of it. We talk about the distinction between moral grandstanding\
  \ and virtue signaling. We ask if moral grandstanding is a recent phenomenon, and\
  \ how we can abuse moral talk. Dr. Tosi explains the five ways people grandstand,\
  \ and the social costs and benefits of it. We then tackle political grandstanding,\
  \ and address the relationship between morality and politics, how politically active\
  \ people can alienate moderates from politics, and people\u2019s overconfidence\
  \ in their moral and political views. We finish with some solutions to fight back\
  \ against moral grandstanding.</p>\n"
