shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 2nd 2020.  \nDr. Justin Tosi is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Philosophy at Texas Tech University. He works in social, political, legal,\
  \ and moral philosophy, and especially on state legitimacy, special obligations,\
  \ and social morality. He\u2019s the author of Grandstanding: The Use and Abuse\
  \ of Moral Talk (co-authored with Brandon Warmke).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ Grandstanding. We define grandstanding, and the different types of it. We talk\
  \ about the distinction between moral grandstanding and virtue signaling. We ask\
  \ if moral grandstanding is a recent phenomenon, and how we can abuse moral talk.\
  \ Dr. Tosi explains the five ways people grandstand, and the social costs and benefits\
  \ of it. We then tackle political grandstanding, and address the relationship between\
  \ morality and politics, how politically active people can alienate moderates form\
  \ politics, and people\u2019s overconfidence in their moral and political views.\
  \ We finish with some solutions to fight back against moral grandstanding.\n\nTime\
