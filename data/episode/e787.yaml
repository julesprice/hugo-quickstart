  \ topics like the limitations and psychological effects of determinism; self-determination\
  \ theory, intrinsic motivation, internal rewards, and autonomy; the role of the\
  \ social environment; organismic integration theory, and how people perform behaviors\
  \ they don\u2019t like; causality orientations theory, and three free-will-relevant\
  \ personality styles; levels of organization, personality, and downward causation;\
  \ how people make decisions; the relationship between happiness and free will; and\
  \ the symbolic self, and potential digital selves.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
