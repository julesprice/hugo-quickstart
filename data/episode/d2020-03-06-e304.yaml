  \ we address what the future might be reserving for us in terms of sexual experiences,\
  \ human relationships and emergent sex technology. We go through the topic of how\
  \ and why sex is still a social taboo. We clarify the fact that, even though we\
  \ focus a lot on the technology, the future will also include the human relationships\
  \ themselves. We refer to some non-normative sex preferences, and how society deals\
  \ with \u201Cdeviant\u201D sex behavior. We then discuss modern sex education, particularly\
  \ in the West, and the new challenges, particularly coming from learning how to\
  \ deal with the virtual world, and things like social media. We talk about the complex\
  \ intricacies of pornography and prostitution for both the consumer and the performer,\
  \ connecting it with sex-positive feminism. We address technology like sex robots\
  \ and teledildonics, and the new kinds of relationships and experiences that they\
  \ already allow for. Finally, we briefly talk about new relationship styles, like\
  \ polyamory, and the challenges involved there.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Bryony\u2019\
