shownotes: '<p>Dr. William Harris is Professor Emeritus of Anatomy at Cambridge University

  Development and Neuroscience since its formation in 2006 until his retirement in

  <p>In this episode, we focus on Zero to Birth. We talk about neural development,
  starting at its early stages, the genetic and environmental factors behind it, and
  how neural stem cells divide and proliferate. We get into post-natal brain growth,
  the regeneration of neurons, how different types of neurons develop, how the brain
  gets wired up and how neurons establish synapses. We also talk about critical periods
  in brain development, the limits of neuroplasticity, what is special about the human
  brain, and lateralization (with a focus on language and handedness). We end with
  a summary of the main messages of the book.</p>
