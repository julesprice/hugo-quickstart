shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 2nd 2023.  \nDr. Paul Bloom is Professor of Psychology\
  \ at the University of Toronto, and Brooks and Suzanne Ragen Professor Emeritus\
  \ of Psychology at Yale University. Dr. Bloom studies how children and adults make\
  \ sense of the world, with special focus on pleasure, morality, religion, fiction,\
  \ and art. He has won numerous awards for his research and teaching. He is past-president\
  \ of the Society for Philosophy and Psychology, and co-editor of Behavioral and\
  \ Brain Sciences. He is the author of seven books, including his latest Psych: The\
  \ Story of the Human Mind.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Psych. We talk about\
  \ a mechanistic conception of mental life in modern psychology, and the relationship\
  \ between the mind and the brain. We discuss modularity of mind. We talk about consciousness\
  \ and its functions. We discuss if Freud\u2019s theories have any scientific value,\
  \ the insights and limitations of Skinner\u2019s behaviorism, and what we learned\
  \ from Piaget about child development. We touch on the nature vs. nurture debate.\
  \ We talk about the relationship between language and thought. We discuss if humans\
  \ are rational. We talk about relational psychology, and phenomena like racism and\
  \ ethnocentrism. We talk about individual differences. We discuss what mental illness\
  \ is, and how we can treat it. Finally, we discuss what a good life for humans is.\n\
