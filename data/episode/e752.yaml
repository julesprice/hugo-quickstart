  \ in modern psychology, and the relationship between the mind and the brain. We\
  \ discuss modularity of mind. We talk about consciousness and its functions. We\
  \ discuss if Freud\u2019s theories have any scientific value, the insights and limitations\
  \ of Skinner\u2019s behaviorism, and what we learned from Piaget about child development.\
  \ We touch on the nature vs. nurture debate. We talk about the relationship between\
  \ language and thought. We discuss if humans are rational. We talk about relational\
  \ psychology, and phenomena like racism and ethnocentrism. We talk about individual\
  \ differences. We discuss what mental illness is, and how we can treat it. Finally,\
  \ we discuss what a good life for humans is.</p>\n"
