shownotes: "<p>Dr. Paul Slovic is a founder and President of Decision Research and\
  \ Professor of Psychology at the University of Oregon, where he studies human judgment,\
  \ decision making, and risk analysis. He and his colleagues worldwide have developed\
  \ methods to describe risk perceptions and measure their impacts on individuals,\
  \ industry, and society. He publishes extensively and serves as a consultant to\
  \ industry and government. Dr. Slovic is a past President of the Society for Risk\
  \ Analysis. He\u2019s the recipient of several awards, and he was also elected to\
  \ the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2015 and the National Academy of\
  \ Sciences in 2016.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we discuss decision-making processes\
  \ in humans, as well as some important biases and heuristics that affect the ways\
  \ we think. And we also apply this knowledge to how people deal with issues like\
  \ climate change, medical and environmental problems (like vaccines and OGMs), genocide,\
  \ nuclear power, and nuclear weapons. We go through a lot of the basics, talking\
  \ about how biases and heuristics work, slow and fast thinking, and bounded relationality.\
  \ We then use that to discuss risk perception. Finally, we talk about teaching people\
  \ about how their minds work, and also the universality (or lack thereof) of these\
  \ cognitive mechanisms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Slovic\u2019s work:</p>\n\
