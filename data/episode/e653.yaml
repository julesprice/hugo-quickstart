  \ psychologist in private practice. Dr. Soper has degrees from the University of\

  \ Evolution of Life Worth Living. We start by talking about the evolution of suicide\
  \ as a by-product, and Dr. Soper\u2019s \u201Cpain-and-brain\u201D theory of suicide.\
  \ We discuss psychological protections against suicide, termed as \u201Ckeepers\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cfenders\u201D by Dr. Soper. We get into self-deception, terror management\
  \ theory, religion, and love. We talk about risk factors and predicting suicide.\
  \ Finally, we talk about the role of psychotherapy, and how to help people who suffer\
  \ from suicidal ideation.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:48  The evolution\
