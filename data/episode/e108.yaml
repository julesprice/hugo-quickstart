  \ US. He\u2019s the author of Thinking Through Cultures: Expeditions in Cultural\
  \ Psychology and Why Do Men Barbecue? Recipes for Cultural Psychology, and editor\

  . He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has served as\
  \ President of the Society for Psychological Anthropology.  \nIn this episode, we\
  \ talk about morality in its several dimensions (philosophical, cultural, evolutionary,\
  \ psychological, anthropological). We also talk about Dr. Shweder\u2019s three moral\
  \ foundations (Autonomy, Community, Divinity), and how Jonathan Haidt contributed\
  \ to their expansion. We also discuss Alan Fiske\u2019s Relational Models, and what\
  \ they are about. I ask Dr. Shweder to explain what is Cultural Psychology, and\
  \ its objects of study in human societies. And we finish off by referring to multiculturalism,\
  \ in what ways it might be problematic, and how to possibly tackle those issues.\n\
