shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 3rd, 2020.\n\nDr. Dick Swaab is an internationally\
  \ renowned researcher in neuroscience, who received numerous awards and published\
  \ over 540 scientific papers. He earned his medical and doctoral degrees at the\
  \ University of Amsterdam and served as director of the Netherlands Institute for\
  \ Neuroscience for 27 years. In 1985, Professor Swaab founded the Netherlands Brain\
  \ Bank, which supplies the international research community with clinical and neuropathological\
  \ brain tissue. Dr. Swaab is Emeritus Professor at the University of Amsterdam and\
  \ Professor at Zhejiang University, Hang Zhou, China since 2007. His major research\
  \ interest focusses on brain development, sexual differentiation, Alzheimer\u2019\
  s disease, the neurobiological basis of depression and eating disorders. In 2008,\
  \ professor Swaab received the Academy medal for his significant role in national\
  \ and international neuroscience. He is the author of the two volume monograph The\
  \ Human Hypothalamus, which appeared in the Handbook of Clinical Neurology series,\
  \ and of the Dutch bestseller We are our Brains, which is translated in German,\
  \ Chinese and Italian.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on the development of gender\
  \ identity and sexual orientation. First, we talk about sexually dimorphic areas\
  \ in the human brain, animal models, and the factors behind their development. We\
  \ then focus on the already identified areas of the brain associated with gender\
  \ identity and sexual orientation. We talk about the \u201Cmosaic\u201D hypothesis\
  \ of the human brain, and also about gender dysphoria, and how we can better help\
  \ trans people.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:36  Are there any well-established sexually\
  \ dimorphic areas in the human brain?  \n04:30  The factors and stages of development\
  \ where these areas develop  \n11:03  Are gender identity and sexual orientation\
  \ innate?  \n13:09  Sexual differentiation in the genitals is independent from what\
  \ happens in the brain  \n14:50  Sex hormones behind sexual differentiation  \n\
  17:07  What can we learn from intersex conditions?  \n18:01  Areas of the brain\
  \ associated with gender identity and sexual orientation  \n24:36  The variability\
  \ in gender identity and sexual orientation  \n27:48  About gender dysphoria  \n\
  29:06  Is there a typical male and female brain? And the \u201Cmosaic\u201D hypothesis.\
  \  \n31:31  Can children correctly identify their gender identity?  \n33:17  How\
  \ to properly deal with trans children  \n35:34  Can we help trans people by learning\
  \ more about brain sexual differentiation?  \n41:47  Why are there more male-to-female\
  \ than female-to-male transsexuals?  \n43:12  Follow Dr. Swaab\u2019s work!\n\n\
