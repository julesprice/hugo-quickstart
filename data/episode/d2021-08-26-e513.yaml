  \ He joined the Harvard faculty in 1972. Dr Friedman\u2019s newest book is Religion\
  \ and the Rise of Capitalism \u2013 a fundamental reassessment of the foundations\
  \ of current-day economics, showing how religious thinking has shaped economic thinking\
  \ ever since the beginnings of modern Western economics and how this influence continues\
  \ to be relevant today especially in the United States.</p>\n<p>In this episode,\
  \ we focus on Religion and the Rise of Capitalism. We get first into a bit of the\
  \ early history of economics. We focus a lot on David Hume and Adam Smith, and also\
  \ in how economic thinking changed after them. We talk about some of the most influential\
  \ schools of thinking in economics during the 19th and 20th centuries. We discuss\
  \ the political influence of the evangelical protestants in the US. We also talk\
  \ about the relationship between capitalism and political ideology, like liberalism\
  \ and conservatism. Finally, we discuss if there is any contradiction between the\
  \ promotion of cooperation by religion, and the competitive nature of capitalism,\
  \ and if we would have ever have modern Western economic thinking without Protestantism.</p>\n"
