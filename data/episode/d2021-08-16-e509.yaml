  \ at the University of Leipzig, Germany. In addition, he is responsible for teaching\

  \ we talk about social media, political communication, fake news and misinformation,\
  \ and political polarization. We start with the benefits and challenges of social\
  \ media. We talk specifically about Facebook escapism. We distinguish between fake\
  \ news, political disinformation, and political misinformation, and discuss if they\
  \ really are widespread phenomena. We also address political polarization, and what\
  \ might be its causes. We ask if the way people engage with politics online differs\
  \ from how they do it in their offline lives.</p>\n"
