shownotes: '<p>Dr. Vassilis Saroglou is Full Professor of Psychology at the UCL-University
  of Louvain, with expertise in psychology of religion, personality, social, and cross-cultural
  psychology, moral psychology, and psychology of positive emotions.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about the psychology of religion. We talk about the
  distinction between intrinsic religiosity and extrinsic religiosity, and between
  devotional religion and coalitional religion. We discuss the relationship between
  religiosity and spirituality. We talk about the psychological traits of religious
  fundamentalists, and religious orientations marked by positive and negative emotionality.
  We discuss what fundamentalists and atheists get wrong about religion. We talk about
  the psychological differences between believers and nonbelievers, and the processes
  of convertion and de-convertion. We discuss if we are naturally predisposed to religiosity,
  if adolescents lean toward becoming nonbelievers, and if old people are bigots.
  We talk about the relationship between religiosity and prosociality, out-group discrimination,
  and psychopathology. Finally, we discuss if religiosity is in decline.</p>
