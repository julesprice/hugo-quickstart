shownotes: "Dr. Vassilis Saroglou is Full Professor of Psychology at the UCL-University\
  \ of Louvain, with expertise in psychology of religion, personality, social, and\
  \ cross-cultural psychology, moral psychology, and psychology of positive emotions.\
  \ He has developed long-term empirical research on theoretically and socially critical\
  \ issues regarding religion, spirituality, fundamentalism, and atheism, in interaction\
  \ with social behavior: prosociality, submission, ethnoreligious & ideological prejudice,\
  \ sexism, homophobia; personality, emotions, and health: personality traits, birth\
  \ order effects, awe, humor; and more.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the psychology\
  \ of religion. We talk about the distinction between intrinsic religiosity and extrinsic\
  \ religiosity, and between devotional religion and coalitional religion. We discuss\
  \ the relationship between religiosity and spirituality. We talk about the psychological\
  \ traits of religious fundamentalists, and religious orientations marked by positive\
  \ and negative emotionality. We discuss what fundamentalists and atheists get wrong\
  \ about religion. We talk about the psychological differences between believers\
  \ and nonbelievers, and the processes of convertion and de-convertion. We discuss\
  \ if we are naturally predisposed to religiosity, if adolescents lean toward becoming\
  \ nonbelievers, and if old people are bigots. We talk about the relationship between\
  \ religiosity and prosociality, out-group discrimination, and psychopathology. Finally,\
  \ we discuss if religiosity is in decline.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:32\
