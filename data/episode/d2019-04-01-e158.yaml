  \ infancy and early childhood years (including attachment), the transition to parenthood,\
  \ the etiology of child maltreatment and the evolutionary basis of parent and child\
  \ functioning. Dr. Belsky's research is marked by a focus upon fathers as well as\

  \ about childhood and attachment theory. We start off by talking about the evolutionary\
  \ and ecological bases of parent-offspring relationships, including parent-offspring\
  \ conflict, and the different evolved strategies of attachment. We also discuss\
  \ modern attachment theory, and the main differences between it and classical attachment\
  \ theory as developed first by John Bowlby, how it relates to life history theory,\
  \ and the several different attachment styles that we have, including secure/autonomous,\
  \ avoidant/dismissing, resistant/preoccupied, and disorganized. In the second part\
  \ of the interview we also refer to parent-offspring conflict and child maltreatment;\
  \ the risks and benefits of daycare; and differential susceptibility in children\
  \ to different life circumstances during their development and different parenting\
  \ styles.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>01:22 The evolutionary bases\
