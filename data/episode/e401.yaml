shownotes: "<p>Dr. Kristina Durante is an associate professor of marketing, Marketing\
  \ Department Vice Chair, and the marketing Ph.D. program coordinator at Rutgers\
  \ Business School. She is a social psychologist interested in the biology of decision-making.\
  \ Her research lies at the intersection of social psychology, evolutionary biology,\
  \ and consumer decision-making. Dr. Durante\u2019s research program focuses on how\
  \ our evolved biology (ancestral ecology and internal physiological systems) and\
  \ our modern social environment interact to influence behavior.</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we focus on ovulation, and women\u2019s mate preferences and consumer\
  \ behavior. We discuss how female intrasexual competition changes across the ovulatory\
  \ cycle, and how that manifests in terms of consumer choices and health-related\
  \ risky behavior. We talk about how we should think about the relationship between\
  \ our evolved psychology and the modern conditions we live in. We refer to what\
  \ happens to women\u2019s consumer patterns in a situation of economic decline.\
  \ In the final part of our talk, we discuss how women can improve their mate preferences,\
  \ to be more in line with modern conditions, and also how they might improve their\
  \ current relationships.</p>\n"
