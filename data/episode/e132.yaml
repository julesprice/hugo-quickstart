shownotes: "Dr. David Papineau is Professor of Philosophy at King's College London\
  \ and at the City University of New York Graduate Center, having previously taught\
  \ for several years at Cambridge University where he was a fellow of Robinson College.\
  \ He was President of the British Society for Philosophy of Science for 1993-5,\
  \ President of the Mind Association for 2009-10, and President of the Aristotelian\
  \ Society for 2013-14. He\u2019s also the author of 9 books, including Philosophical\
  \ Naturalism, Thinking About Consciousness, and Knowing the Score.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about naturalism, and consciousness and mental phenomena. We start by\
  \ discussing what naturalism is; if there are problems that science can\u2019t deal\
  \ with; and how philosophy can contribute to science and the scientific method.\
  \ Then, we move on to talking about consciousness. We first tackle the issues with\
  \ mind-brain dualism, and then we discuss consciousness and action, and the Libet\
  \ experiments in the 1980\u2019s; we also deal with the hard problem of consciousness,\
  \ and the issues with emergentism. Finally, we debate the possibility of mental\
  \ phenomena being nothing more than illusions, and what is real in how we experience\
  \ the world, with a focus on our perceptual systems.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:08  What\
