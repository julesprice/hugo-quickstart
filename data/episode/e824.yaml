  \ episode, we focus on \u201CLike, Literally, Dude\u201D. We start by talking about\
  \ what people call \u201Cbad\u201D English, the history of standardization and prescription\
  \ in English, and how grammar rules are mostly arbitrary. We discuss who drives\
  \ linguistics change, and the role of women and low-status people. We talk about\
  \ what gender has to do with how we speak. We then talk about the uses of filled\
  \ pauses like \u201Cum\u201D and \u201Cuh\u201D, and the uses of \u201Clike\u201D\
  , \u201CI mean\u201D, \u201Cyou know\u201D, and \u201Cso\u201D. We also talk about\
  \ the meaning of \u201Cdude\u201D, and \u201Cliterally\u201D, and we discuss if\
  \ words have any intrinsic meaning. Finally, we discuss the current proposal of\
  \ using \u201Cthey/them\u201D as singular personal pronouns to refer to non-binary\
  \ people, and removing/banning words from classic books.</p>\n"
