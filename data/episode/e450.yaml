shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 20th 2021.  \nDr. Kirsty Graham is Research Associate\
  \ at the University of St. Andrews. Her PhD research, supervised by Prof. Richard\
  \ Byrne, catalogued the full gestural repertoire of wild bonobos. She examined individual\
  \ differences in repertoire size and usage. Most importantly, she defined the meaning\
  \ of each gesture type by determining the reaction given by the recipient that satisfies\
  \ the signaller. Understanding meanings or ambiguity of meanings for wild bonobo\
  \ gestural communication provides insights into the evolution of our own complex\
  \ communication system.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about gestural communication\
  \ in primates. We discuss what communication is from an evolutionary perspective.\
  \ We then get into gestural communication, focusing on bonobos, chimpanzees, and\
  \ humans. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:57  What is communication?  \n03:25\
