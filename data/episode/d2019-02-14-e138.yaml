  \ Theory of Consciousness (2017).</p>\n<p>In this episode, the central topic is\
  \ consciousness. We talk about what is it; the hard problem of consciousness; illusionism;\
  \ the evolutionary origins and function of consciousness; how consciousness relates\
  \ to questions surrounding free will and determinism. Toward the end, we also discuss\
  \ a little bit if AI could spontaneously develop consciousness in any way, or if\
  \ we would need to program it into it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>00:55 What\
