  <p>In this episode, we talk about norms, moral emotions, and human cooperation.
  We start with norms, and their social functions. We talk about norm violations,
  and punishment. We get into the moral emotions of disgust and anger. We discuss
  how disgust sensitivity might link to opposition to immigration. We also talk about
  cooperation in contexts of hierarchy and power asymmetries, and Interdependence
  Theory and human cooperation.</p>
