shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 12th 2022.  \nDr. Catherine Molho is an Assistant Professor\
  \ of Social Psychology at VU Amsterdam. Dr. Molho is a psychologist studying human\
  \ cooperation, morality, and the role of emotions in decision-making. She draws\
  \ upon insights from social and evolutionary psychology, behavioral economics, and\
  \ evolutionary biology to better understand the factors underlying cooperative and\
  \ punitive decisions. In her work, she uses decision-making experiments, questionnaires,\
  \ and intensive experience sampling methods.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about norms,\
  \ moral emotions, and human cooperation. We start with norms, and their social functions.\
  \ We talk about norm violations, and punishment. We get into the moral emotions\
  \ of disgust and anger. We discuss how disgust sensitivity might link to opposition\
  \ to immigration. We also talk about cooperation in contexts of hierarchy and power\
  \ asymmetries, and Interdependence Theory and human cooperation.\n\nTime Links:\
