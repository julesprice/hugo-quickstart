shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 22nd 2021.  \nDr. Luke Russell is Associate Professor\
  \ in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Sydney. His research explores\
  \ moral philosophy and he has written about evil, forgiveness, virtue and vice.\
  \ Dr. Russell teaches ethics, moral psychology, and critical thinking, as well as\
  \ running the University's high school philosophy course, Mind and Morality. His\
  \ new book is Being Evil: A Philosophical Perspective.\n\nIn this episode, we focus\
  \ on Being Evil. We ask what evil is, and go through several different criteria\
  \ we can use to say that a particular action or person in evil, including its extremity,\
  \ the consequences, incomprehensibility, people\u2019s reactions, the perpetrator\u2019\
  s motives, and others. We talk about depictions of evil in fiction, and ask if they\
  \ are useful. We discuss some possible psychological traits of evil people, and\
  \ refer to Arendt\u2019s banality of evil. Finally, we discuss if people are born\
  \ evil, and what we can do to help them.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:35\
