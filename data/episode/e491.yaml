shownotes: "<p>Dr. Chiara Marletto is Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the Department\
  \ of Physics at Oxford University. Her research interests include Quantum Theory\
  \ of Computation, Foundations of Physics, Condensed-Matter Physics and Quantum Biology.\
  \ She is the author of The Science of Can and Can't: A Physicist's Journey through\
  \ the Land of Counterfactuals.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on The Science\
  \ of Can and Can\u2019t. We start by defining \u201Ccounterfactual\u201D, and we\
  \ ask what it means for something to be designed. We get into how to get a new explanation\
  \ of work and heat through the science of counterfactuals. We talk about counterfactuals\
  \ in quantum systems, and the quantum theory of information. We ask what knowledge\
  \ is from this perspective. We discuss biology, and how concepts like \u201Ccatalyst\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cresilience\u201D can help us better understand it from a Physics perspective,\
  \ and how knowledge applies in that domain. We talk about psychological phenomena,\
  \ and reductionist explanations. We ask how we could unify quantum mechanics and\
  \ general relativity. We talk about the implications for epistemology and science.\
  \ Finally, we ask if the Universe is predetermined.</p>\n"
