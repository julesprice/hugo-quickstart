shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 31st 2021.  \nDr. Chiara Marletto is Postdoctoral Research\
  \ Assistant in the Department of Physics at Oxford University. Her research interests\
  \ include Quantum Theory of Computation, Foundations of Physics, Condensed-Matter\
  \ Physics and Quantum Biology. She is the recipient of numerous awards including\
  \ the \"Graduate Prize Scholarship\" at Merton College, 2012; \"Optime\" Award for\
  \ Academic Excellence, offered by Unione Industriale di Torino, 2011; and the \"\
  Ing. Vittorino Pollo e Dott.Ssa Zita Pollo\" Award for Academic Excellence, offered\
  \ by Fondazione Giovanni Agnelli, 2010. She is the author of The Science of Can\
  \ and Can't: A Physicist's Journey through the Land of Counterfactuals.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on The Science of Can and Can\u2019t. We start by defining \u201C\
  counterfactual\u201D, and we ask what it means for something to be designed. We\
  \ get into how to get a new explanation of work and heat through the science of\
  \ counterfactuals. We talk about counterfactuals in quantum systems, and the quantum\
  \ theory of information. We ask what knowledge is from this perspective. We discuss\
  \ biology, and how concepts like \u201Ccatalyst\u201D and \u201Cresilience\u201D\
  \ can help us better understand it from a Physics perspective, and how knowledge\
  \ applies in that domain. We talk about psychological phenomena, and reductionist\
  \ explanations. We ask how we could unify quantum mechanics and general relativity.\
  \ We talk about the implications for epistemology and science. Finally, we ask if\
  \ the Universe is predetermined.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:25  What is\
