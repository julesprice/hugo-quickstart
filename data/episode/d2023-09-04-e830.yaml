shownotes: "<p>Dr. \xC9mile Torres is a researcher at Leibniz Universit\xE4t Hannover,\
  \ in\nGermany. Their work over the past decade has centered around a single theme:\
  \ eschatology, whether religious, secular, or scientific. Recently, their work has\
  \ been focused on the nature and causes of human extinction, its ethical implications,\
  \ and the history of the idea.\_They are the author of Morality, Foresight, and\
  \ Human Flourishing: An Introduction to Existential Risks, and their latest book\
  \ is Human Extinction: A History of the Science and Ethics of Annihilation.</p>\n\
  <p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about effective altruism and longtermism.\
  \ We discuss the philosophical tenets of effective altruism (EA), whether it is\
  \ utilitarian, and if it is more \u201Crational\u201D than other moral theories.\
  \ We get into criticisms of EA, regarding how \u201Ceffective\u201D it really is;\
  \ not caring about systemic change; and criticisms of philanthropy. We then talk\
  \ about longtermism: where it comes from; the existential risks it cares about;\
  \ caring about future people at the expense of people alive right now; and the link\
  \ between longtermism and eugenics.</p>\n"
