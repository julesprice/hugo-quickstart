  \ Gintis\u2019 work for the last two decades - a framework for the unification of\
  \ the behavioral sciences \u2013 and the several obstacles that we have to that,\
  \ including the fact that different behavioral sciences have different approaches\
  \ and focus on different aspects. We also talk about the relationship between culture\
  \ and biology. Finally, we go from there to the particularities of human cooperation,\
  \ group selection, and the role that social institutions play.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n\
