shownotes: "<p>Dr. Alice H. Eagly is Emerita Professor of Psychology and of Management\
  \ and Organizations at Northwestern University. She currently holds the James Padilla\
  \ Chair for Arts and Sciences and a Faculty Fellowship for the Institute of Policy\
  \ Research at Northwestern University. Her primary research contributions have been\
  \ in the area of social psychology, as well as personality psychology and Industrial\
  \ Organizational Psychology. Her research interests include the psychology of gender,\
  \ especially sex differences and similarities in leadership, prosocial behavior,\
  \ aggression, partner preferences, and sociopolitical attitudes. She\u2019s also\
  \ interested in the content of stereotypes; social role theory as a theory of sex\
  \ differences and similarities and of the origins of sex differences in social behavior;\
  \ and attitude theory and research, especially attitudinal selectivity in information\
  \ processing.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about the psychology of gender, and\
  \ the several different approaches to it. We first talk about some of the most well-established\
  \ sex differences and their origins. We refer to the nature-nurture debate, and\
  \ Dr. Eagly\u2019s social role theory. We then go through some of what Dr. Eagly\
  \ thinks are the limitations of the approaches from evolutionary psychology and\
  \ social constructionism, while also addressing the gender equality paradox. We\
  \ then discuss feminist issues, namely how feminism should deal with sex differences;\
  \ what is gender equality (and the issue with quotas); female leadership; how gender\
  \ stereotypes have changed over time; and the future of gender equality.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
