shownotes: '<p>Dr. Matteo Colombo is an Associate Professor in the Tilburg Center
  for Logic, Ethics, and Philosophy of Science, and in the Department of Philosophy
  at Tilburg University. Much of his work is in the foundations of computational neuroscience,
  philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, and moral psychology.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about topics in neuroscience, cognitive science, and
  philosophy of science. We start by talking about experimental philosophy and the
  questions it deals with. We talk about the relationship between intellectual humility
  and prejudice. We discuss large-scale brain simulations, what they aim at, and if
  they have been productive. We address debates in the cognitive sciences like the
  levels of explanation debate, and the debate between the nativists and the empiricists.
  We discuss if value-free science is possible; what the appraisal of scientific hypotheses
  is influence by; and the relationship between neuroscience, philosophy of science,
  philosophy of mind, and moral psychology.</p>
