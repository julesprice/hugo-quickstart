shownotes: "<p>Dr. Alex Mesoudi is an Associate Professor of Cultural Evolution at\
  \ the Human Behaviour and Cultural Evolution Group at the University of Exeter\u2019\
  s Cornwall Campus, UK. He studies cultural evolution, both in the lab and by constructing\
  \ models and simulations of it. He\u2019s also the author of the book Cultural Evolution:\
  \ How Darwinian Theory Can Explain Human Culture and Synthesize the Social Sciences.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about some of the theoretical foundations of cultural\
  \ evolution. We first discuss the relationship between culture and biology, and\
  \ how we can get differences between groups. We refer to cultural group selection.\
  \ Also, to issues regarding traditional social science. We talk about integrating\
  \ lab studies and ethnographic studies. We then get into the differences and similarities\
  \ between cultural evolution and modern synthesis genetic evolution. Finally, we\
  \ talk about Galton\u2019s problem and how to be sure that the cultures we are studying\
  \ are independent, and also about migration and cultural transmission.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
