shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 24th 2022.  \nDr. Scott Claessens is a Postdoctoral\
  \ Research Fellow at the University of Auckland. He studies the biological and cultural\
  \ evolution of human cooperation. He uses methods from experimental economics and\
  \ evolutionary game theory to shed light on how and why we give to others.\n\nIn\
  \ this episode, we talk about human cooperation, religiosity, and cross-national\
  \ analyses. We discuss theories about why humans are so cooperative; the benefits\
  \ people get from being seen to be cooperative; the \u201Ccooperative phenotype\u201D\
  , and what personality traits might correlate with prosociality; why prosociality\
  \ varies across societies; if prosociality is associated with relational mobility;\
  \ and what need-based transfer systems are. We talk about the relationship between\
  \ religiosity and prosociality and well-being. Finally, we discuss the issue of\
  \ non-independence in cross-national analyses.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n\
