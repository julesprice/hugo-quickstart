shownotes: "<p>Dr. Scott Claessens is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University\
  \ of Auckland. He studies the biological and cultural evolution of human cooperation.\
  \ He uses methods from experimental economics and evolutionary game theory to shed\
  \ light on how and why we give to others.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about\
  \ human cooperation, religiosity, and cross-national analyses. We discuss theories\
  \ about why humans are so cooperative; the benefits people get from being seen to\
  \ be cooperative; the \u201Ccooperative phenotype\u201D, and what personality traits\
  \ might correlate with prosociality; why prosociality varies across societies; if\
  \ prosociality is associated with relational mobility; and what need-based transfer\
  \ systems are. We talk about the relationship between religiosity and prosociality\
  \ and well-being. Finally, we discuss the issue of non-independence in cross-national\
  \ analyses.</p>\n"
