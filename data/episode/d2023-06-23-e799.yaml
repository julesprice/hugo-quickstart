shownotes: '<p>Dr. Pasquale Raia is Professor of Paleontology and Paleoecology at
  the University of Naples Federico II. His scientific interests concern the evolution
  and the dynamics of extinction of animal species, and in particular the fossils
  of hominid species. His most notable scientific contributions regard evolutionary
  theories about the evolution of insular species, the complexity of organisms, and
  the dynamics of extinction of hominids.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we start by talking about climate change as a factor in evolution,
  and what drives the extinction of species. We discuss how increased specialization
  can be a problem. We get into how climate change impacted the evolution of hominins.
  We talk about why Neanderthals went extinct and H. sapiens survived, and how similar
  their cognitive ability was. We discuss how H. sapiens was able to increase its
  habitable area. We talk about what drove the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna.
  Finally, we discuss the relationship between morphological integration and functional
  performance, and how it influences evolution.</p>
