shownotes: '<p>Dr. Victor Kumar is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Boston University.
  He is director of the Mind and Morality Lab. His primary philosophical interests
  are in ethics, cognitive science, and evolutionary theory. He is the author (with
  Richmond Campbell) of A Better Ape: The Evolution of the Moral Mind and How it Made
  us Human.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on A Better Ape. We first present the gene-culture
  coevolution framework used in the book. We get into the three ingredients of the
  moral mind: core moral emotions (sympathy, loyalty, trust, respect, guilt, shame,
  resentment, and indignation); core moral norms (harm, kinship, reciprocity, autonomy,
  and fairness); and a capacity for open-ended moral reasoning. We discuss moral intuition,
  and why moral reasoning is not all about post-hoc rationalization. We talk about
  moral progress, and the role of ideas. We talk about institutional moralities. We
  discuss the role of religion, and moral philosophy. We ask if it is possible to
  a universal ethical code. Finally, we talk about political correctness, and a theoretical
  framework for addressing injustice and inequality.</p>
