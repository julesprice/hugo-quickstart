  \ Societies in Maribor, and Researcher at the Research Center for Strategy and Governance\
  \ at the University of Ljubljana. His last two books are Rational Choice and Democratic\

  \ Virtues and Vices of the Modern Economy (Routledge, 2022).</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>This\
  \ time, we focus on Rational Choice and Democratic Government. We talk about how\
  \ old democracies are. We define liberal democracy, and talk about political and\
  \ civil rights. We discuss the rise of democracies, the recent \u201Cdemocratic\
  \ recession\u201D, and the 2008 economic crisis. We discuss how levels of democracy\
  \ are evaluated. We get into rational choice theory, self-interest, and incentives.\
  \ We discuss explanations for the rise and spread of democracy. We talk about voting\
  \ behavior, and discuss how much we should worry about average voters being uninformed.\
  \ We discuss how both market failure and government failure occur. We talk about\
  \ where public choice analyses fail. We discuss if democracy contributes to peace.\
  \ Finally, we discuss if Francis Fukuyama was right, and if we should expect liberal-democratic\
  \ capitalist societies to be more successful than authoritarian state-capitalist\
  \ societies.</p>\n"
