  \ we talk about fiction, and worldbuilding. We first focus on how to create compelling\
  \ characters, and we refer to the Game of Thrones series finale as a bad example\
  \ of it. We also explore the psychology of failed expectations. We then get into\
  \ how people want meaning from fiction, and how tragedies like war might provide\
  \ that. We also discuss popular genres and why they are so successful, and how politics\
  \ and morality might ruin good literature. We finish by talking about how fiction\
  \ can work as a thought-experiment, and how it is not so detached from things humans\
  \ develop through culture.\n\nTime Links:  \n02:23  Creating characters that are\
