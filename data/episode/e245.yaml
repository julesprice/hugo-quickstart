shownotes: "Dr. Daniel Conroy-Beam is Assistant Professor of Psychology in the Department\
  \ of Psychological & Brain Sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara\
  \ (UCSB). He uses an evolutionary perspective to understand how mate preferences\
  \ are linked to actual mating outcomes. Specifically, he is interested in how mate\
  \ preferences are integrated with one another computationally in order to make mating\
  \ decisions. His work combines agent-based modeling of mate choice evolution with\
  \ studies of real couples to compare and explore candidate algorithms for how people\
  \ select their mating strategies, evaluate potential mates, and regulate their relationships.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on human mating. We talk about some of the most well-established\
  \ mate preferences. We then get into how people choose mates based on these same\
  \ preferences, and we focus mostly on Euclidian algorithms, as explored by Dr. Conroy-Beam\
  \ in his work, and all of the phenomena that we are able to study and understand\
  \ through them. We specifically address things like relationship satisfaction, mate\
  \ switching, and mate retention tactics. We also talk about studying sex differences\
  \ using multivariate analyses, opposite-sex friendships, and mysteries in human\
  \ mating that we have yet to answer. We end up by talking about some limitations\
  \ in traditional evolutionary psychology, and how things are expected to progress\
  \ in the near future.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:03  What we know about human mate preferences\
