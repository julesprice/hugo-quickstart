shownotes: "<p>Dr. Daniel Conroy-Beam is Assistant Professor of Psychology in the\
  \ Department of Psychological &amp; Brain Sciences at the University of California,\
  \ Santa Barbara (UCSB). He uses an evolutionary perspective to understand how mate\
  \ preferences are linked to actual mating outcomes. Specifically, he is interested\
  \ in how mate preferences are integrated with one another computationally in order\
  \ to make mating decisions. His work combines agent-based modeling of mate choice\
  \ evolution with studies of real couples to compare and explore candidate algorithms\
  \ for how people select their mating strategies, evaluate potential mates, and regulate\
  \ their relationships.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on human mating. We talk\
  \ about some of the most well-established mate preferences. We then get into how\
  \ people choose mates based on these same preferences, and we focus mostly on Euclidian\
  \ algorithms, as explored by Dr. Conroy-Beam in his work, and all of the phenomena\
  \ that we are able to study and understand through them. We specifically address\
  \ things like relationship satisfaction, mate switching, and mate retention tactics.\
  \ We also talk about studying sex differences using multivariate analyses, opposite-sex\
  \ friendships, and mysteries in human mating that we have yet to answer. We end\
  \ up by talking about some limitations in traditional evolutionary psychology, and\
  \ how things are expected to progress in the near future.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow\
