  \ food consumption as political behavior. We get into some of the most prominent\
  \ kinds of farming technologies, including organic farming, GMO (genetically modified\
  \ organism) crops, and indoor farming, and discuss a bit their advantages, disadvantages,\
  \ and applications. We talk about consuming local. We discuss the connection between\
  \ food production and the environment. We also discuss the how viable would it be\
  \ for everyone to become vegan, and if it would be a good solution. Finally, we\

  \ be done politically and by individual citizens.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro\
