  \ on Resetting the Table. We start by framing food consumption as political behavior.\
  \ We get into some of the most prominent kinds of farming technologies, including\
  \ organic farming, GMO (genetically modified organism) crops, and indoor farming,\
  \ and discuss a bit their advantages, disadvantages, and applications. We talk about\
  \ consuming local. We discuss the connection between food production and the environment.\
  \ We also discuss the how viable would it be for everyone to become vegan, and if\
  \ it would be a good solution. Finally, we talk about the main ways we should reset\
  \ our tables (in the West), and what can be done politically and by individual citizens.</p>\n"
