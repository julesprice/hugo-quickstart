  <p>In this episode, we talk about ethics and veganism. We start by discussing objectivity
  in ethics, and how we can objectively determine right and wrong. We get into ethical
  intuitionism, and discuss where our ethical intuitions come from, including their
  evolutionary bases. We talk about objections to moral nihilism and moral relativism.
  We talk about the relationship between science and ethics. We then discuss several
  different questions in animal ethics, including what makes an animal worthy of moral
  consideration; animal rights, and legislation concerning animal wellbeing; the extinction
  of the animals from the meat industry; anti-natalism; how we should deal with carnivore
  species; cannibalism; and if it would be possible for all of us to become vegan.</p>
