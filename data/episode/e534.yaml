shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 30th 2021.  \nDr. Michael Huemer is a professor of philosophy\
  \ at the University of Colorado. He is the author of more than seventy academic\
  \ articles in epistemology, ethics, metaethics, metaphysics, and political philosophy,\
  \ as well as several books, like Skepticism and the Veil of Perception, Ethical\
  \ Intuitionism, The Problem of Political Authority, Approaching Infinity, Paradox\
  \ Lost, and Dialogues on Ethical Vegetarianism.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ ethics and veganism. We start by discussing objectivity in ethics, and how we\
  \ can objectively determine right and wrong. We get into ethical intuitionism, and\
  \ discuss where our ethical intuitions come from, including their evolutionary bases.\
  \ We talk about objections to moral nihilism and moral relativism. We talk about\
  \ the relationship between science and ethics. We then discuss several different\
  \ questions in animal ethics, including what makes an animal worthy of moral consideration;\
  \ animal rights, and legislation concerning animal wellbeing; the extinction of\
  \ the animals from the meat industry; anti-natalism; how we should deal with carnivore\
  \ species; cannibalism; and if it would be possible for all of us to become vegan.\n\
