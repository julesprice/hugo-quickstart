  \ Lisbon in 1996 after studying Physics at the University of Lisbon. He taught Mathematics\
  \ and IT in Secondary and Polythecnical schools. In 2014 he obtained his PhD in\

  \ to Sustainability.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we get into the Philosophy of Quantum\
  \ Mechanics. We talk about the pilot wave theory, quantum gravity, and the EmDrive,\
  \ or the radio frequency (RF) resonant cavity thruster. In the last part of the\
  \ interview, we also discuss the relationship between philosophy and science in\
  \ the modern era.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Castro\u2019s work:</p>\n\
