  \ We talk about the pilot wave theory, quantum gravity, and the EmDrive, or the\
  \ radio frequency (RF) resonant cavity thruster. In the last part of the interview,\
  \ we also discuss the relationship between philosophy and science in the modern\
  \ era. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:24  The pilot wave theory in quantum physics  \n17:01\
