shownotes: "<p>Dr. Ian Gilligan is Honorary Associate Professor in the Department\
  \ of Archaeology of the University of Sydney. He graduated in psychology (UNSW)\
  \ and medicine (Sydney University) before studying prehistoric archaeology (Sydney\
  \ University) and biological anthropology (PhD ANU). He specializes in the origin\
  \ of clothing and the role of textiles in the transition to agriculture. He also\
  \ has an interest in traditional clothing in Aboriginal Australia, particularly\
  \ in Tasmania during the last ice age. In addition, he explores the wider psychological\
  \ and philosophical aspects of wearing clothes. He\u2019s also the author of the\
  \ recent book Climate, Clothing, and Agriculture in Prehistory: Linking Evidence,\
  \ Causes, and Effects (2018).</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about the evolution\
  \ of clothing and the adoption of agriculture in human societies. First, we talk\
  \ about hypotheses as to how our naked skin might have evolved, and when in our\
  \ evolutionary history we started wearing clothes and the environmental factors\
  \ that favored its development. We also briefly refer to the limitations in terms\
  \ of the information we can derive from studies on modern hunter-gatherers, if we\u2019\
  re trying to learn more about how our species evolved and how people behaved back\
  \ in the Pleistocene. We go through the differences between simples and complex\
  \ clothing (the latter includes textile clothing), and also between clothing based\
  \ on animal skin and fur and clothing based on textiles. Then, we discuss the ways\
  \ by which clothing might have played a causal role in the adoption of agriculture\
  \ and making it the center of our economy, the problems that early agricultural\
  \ societies went through, and also why we domesticated animals. We finish off by\
  \ talking about the psychological and social aspects of clothing, including decoration.</p>\n\
