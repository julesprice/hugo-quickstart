shownotes: "<p>Dr. Agner Fog is associate professor of computer science at Technical\
  \ University of Denmark. Dr. Fog does research in Evolutionary Anthropology, Cultural\
  \ Anthropology, Social systems and Computer Science. His current project is 'Theory\
  \ of cultural change based on evolutionary psychology, evolutionary biology, and\
  \ cultural evolution.' He\u2019s the author of \u201CWarlike and Peaceful Societies:\
  \ The Interaction of Genes and Culture\u201D.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about\
  \ warlike and peaceful societies. We discuss if war is part of human nature, and\
  \ the ecological conditions that favor war and peace. We also mention the social\
  \ structure of warlike societies. We ask why most warriors and chiefs are men. We\
  \ then get into regality theory, and the differences between what Dr. Fog calls\
  \ regal and kungic societies. We talk about the different types of war, focusing\
  \ mostly on civil wars, and we also about terrorism and counterterrorist measures.\
  \ We also refer to the Long Peace, authoritarianism on the right and the left, and\
  \ scaremongering (in mass media). Finally, we talk about why Scandinavian peoples\
  \ are the happiest in the world, and if regality theory can help us prevent and\
  \ end wars, and change political systems.</p>\n"
