shownotes: "Dr. Gustavo Carlo is Millsap Professor of Diversity in the Department\
  \ of Human Development and Family Science at the University of Missouri. His research\
  \ areas and interests include: Prosocial and moral development among children and\
  \ adolescents; Temperament, family correlates, social cognition and emotions, and\
  \ culture-related variables associated with such development; and Positive health\
  \ and adjustment among Latino families and youth. He\u2019s also been the recipient\
  \ of several awards, including the 2017 Top Faculty Achiever from the University\
  \ of Missouri, and the 2018 Outstanding Mentor Award from the Society for Research\
  \ on Adolescence.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on prosocial and moral development\
  \ in children and adolescents. We refer to the important contributions of genes\
  \ and the environment, and the many complications associated with studying the different\
  \ factors; the \u201Cstages\u201D approach in developmental psychology; and the\
  \ development of gender. We also talk about peer pressure, and the shared and non-shared\
  \ environments; different social cognitions; and, finally, if development still\
  \ occurs in adulthood.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:02  Prosocial and moral development\
