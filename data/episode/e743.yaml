shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 19th 2022.  \nDr. Vibeke Ottesen is a Norwegian criminologist\
  \ with an interest in how nature and nurture combined create human behavior. She\
  \ has a popular science blog \u2013 Biosocial - where she comments on news, scientific\
  \ findings and literature relevant to her subject \u2013 more often than not with\
  \ an evolutionary informed approach to understanding the subject matter. She has\
  \ held numerous lectures on the benefits of an evolutionary informed approach to\
  \ understanding the cross-cultural sex and age differences in anti-social and criminal\
  \ behavior. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about violence from an evolutionary perspective.\
  \ We get into the causes of criminal behavior, and discuss the relationship between\
  \ mental illness and crime. We talk about the evolved functions of violence, violence\
  \ as an intrasexual competition strategy, and the archaeological and ethnographic\
  \ evidence behind it. In the last part of the interview, we discuss the relationship\
  \ between legal access to abortion and levels of neonaticide, as well as the evolutionary\
  \ rationale behind the opposition to abortion, as a way of controlling female sexual\
  \ behavior. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:26  Violence from an evolutionary\
