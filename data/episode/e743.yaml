shownotes: "<p>Dr. Vibeke Ottesen is a Norwegian criminologist with an interest in\
  \ how nature and nurture combined create human behavior. She has a popular science\
  \ blog \u2013 Biosocial - where she comments on news, scientific findings and literature\
  \ relevant to her subject \u2013 more often than not with an evolutionary informed\
  \ approach to understanding the subject matter.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk\
  \ about violence from an evolutionary perspective. We get into the causes of criminal\
  \ behavior, and discuss the relationship between mental illness and crime. We talk\
  \ about the evolved functions of violence, violence as an intrasexual competition\
  \ strategy, and the archaeological and ethnographic evidence behind it. In the last\
  \ part of the interview, we discuss the relationship between legal access to abortion\
  \ and levels of neonaticide, as well as the evolutionary rationale behind the opposition\
  \ to abortion, as a way of controlling female sexual behavior.</p>\n"
