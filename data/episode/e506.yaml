shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 30th 2021.  \nCrystal Lee is a PhD candidate at the\
  \ History / Anthropology / Science, Technology, and Society (HASTS) program at MIT,\
  \ a researcher at the Visualization Group in the Computer Science and Artificial\
  \ Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and a Fellow at Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein\
  \ Center for Internet and Society. Her research focuses on how people interpret\
  \ and make data visualizations. She also thinks a lot about the relationship between\
  \ technology and disability, and she loves talking about mixed methods research\
  \ that combines humanistic questions with data science and critical cartography.\
  \ In her work as a Digital Teaching Fellow at Harvard, she created a curriculum\
  \ to integrate digital mapping and visualization into the history of science. Previously,\
  \ she was a visiting research scientist at the European Commission, and she graduated\
  \ with high honors from Stanford University.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about online\
  \ misinformation, and data visualizations. We start with data visualizations, and\
  \ talk specifically about their impact on how information was conveyed during the\
  \ covid-19 pandemic. We then discuss online misinformation. Finally, we talk about\
  \ the work Crystal is doing on developing data visualizations for people with disabilities,\
  \ like for example blind people.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:30  Data visualizations\
