shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 30th 2022.  \nDr. William Harris is Professor Emeritus\
  \ of Anatomy at Cambridge University and fellow of Clare College, Cambridge. He\
  \ was head of the Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience since its\
  \ formation in 2006 until his retirement in 2018. He was elected a Fellow of the\
  \ Royal Society in 2007, a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2007, and\
  \ a member of the European Molecular Biology Organisation in 2012. In 2017, he was\
  \ awarded the Waddington Medal by the British Society for Developmental Biology\
  \ for his work on the development of the visual system. He is the author of Zero\
  \ to Birth: How the Human Brain Is Built.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Zero to\
  \ Birth. We talk about neural development, starting at its early stages, the genetic\
  \ and environmental factors behind it, and how neural stem cells divide and proliferate.\
  \ We get into post-natal brain growth, the regeneration of neurons, how different\
  \ types of neurons develop, how the brain gets wired up and how neurons establish\
  \ synapses. We also talk about critical periods in brain development, the limits\
  \ of neuroplasticity, what is special about the human brain, and lateralization\
  \ (with a focus on language and handedness). We end with a summary of the main messages\
  \ of the book.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:28  The premise of the book \
