  <p>In this episode, we focus on The Eternal Decline and Fall of Rome. We walk through\
  \ topics like: when did people start theorizing about the decline and fall of Rome;\
  \ the actual factors that played a role in the fall of Rome; periods in Roman history\
  \ where there was renewal without decline, and decline and false renewal; dynamics\
  \ of conservatism, decline, renewal, and progress in the history of Rome; the role\
  \ of Christianity in the later stages of the Western Roman Empire, and in the Byzantine\
  \ Empire; Europe in the aftermath of the fall of Rome; the Holy Roman Empire; the\
  \ \u201Cdecline of the West\u201D, if it is real, and how populists on the right\
  \ and the left take advantage of narratives of \u201Cdecline\u201D. Finally, we\
  \ discuss how we can prevent populist political movements from rising, and the ethical\
  \ duty of historians.</p>\n"
