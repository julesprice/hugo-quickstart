shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 4th, 2019.  \nDr. Robert Dunn is William Neal Reynolds\
  \ Distinguished Professor in the Department of Applied Ecology at North Carolina\
  \ State University. He is known for efforts to involve the public as citizen scientists\
  \ in arthropod surveys and bacterial flora studies. His projects include studies\
  \ of belly button biodiversity, mites that live on human faces, ants in backyards,\
  \ and fungi and bacteria in houses. He\u2019s the author of five books, his most\
  \ recent one being Never Home Alone: From Microbes to Millipedes, Camel Crickets,\
  \ and Honeybees, the Natural History of Where We Live.\n\nIn this episode, we focus\
  \ on Never Home Alone. We discuss how living in homes changed our dynamics with\
  \ other species, particularly species of insects, bacteria and fungi, and how some\
  \ of them adapted to the home environment. We talk about how some of them are neutral,\
  \ others beneficial, and still others detrimental to our health, and also about\
  \ the importance of being exposed to biodiversity. We also get into the effects\
  \ that the most common pets (cats and dogs) might have on us. We discuss food processing,\
  \ how our houses promote the development of harmful species, and, finally, how in\
  \ the future we might be able to garden the microorganisms we need.\n\nTime Links:\
  \  \n01:31  How we became \u201CHomo indoorus\u201D  \n04:20  Did homes change how\
  \ we and other species evolved?   \n10:43  Species that are adapted to our homes\
  \   \n12:05  Are home species mostly beneficial or detrimental to our health?  \n\
  14:43  The importance of biodiversity (the biodiversity hypothesis)  \n21:44  Examples\
  \ of bacteria and insect species that have beneficial effects  \n29:31  Biodiversity\

  40:36  How food processing alters its bacterial components  \n44:53  Places, materials\
  \ and conditions in our homes that promote the growth of harmful microbes  \n51:16\
