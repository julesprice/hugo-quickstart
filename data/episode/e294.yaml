shownotes: "<p>Dr. Robert Dunn is William Neal Reynolds Distinguished Professor in\
  \ the Department of Applied Ecology at North Carolina State University. He is known\
  \ for efforts to involve the public as citizen scientists in arthropod surveys and\
  \ bacterial flora studies. His projects include studies of belly button biodiversity,\
  \ mites that live on human faces, ants in backyards, and fungi and bacteria in houses.\
  \ He\u2019s the author of five books, his most recent one being Never Home Alone:\
  \ From Microbes to Millipedes, Camel Crickets, and Honeybees, the Natural History\
  \ of Where We Live.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Never Home Alone. We discuss\
  \ how living in homes changed our dynamics with other species, particularly species\
  \ of insects, bacteria and fungi, and how some of them adapted to the home environment.\
  \ We talk about how some of them are neutral, others beneficial, and still others\
  \ detrimental to our health, and also about the importance of being exposed to biodiversity.\
  \ We also get into the effects that the most common pets (cats and dogs) might have\
  \ on us. We discuss food processing, how our houses promote the development of harmful\
  \ species, and, finally, how in the future we might be able to garden the microorganisms\
  \ we need.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Dunn\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Faculty page:\
