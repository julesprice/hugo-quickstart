  \ of Mental Depth and The Improvised Mind\u201D.  \nIn this episode, the conversation\
  \ revolves around the main topics of Dr. Chater\u2019s book, The Mind is Flat. We\
  \ talk about the many illusions that compose our minds, from the way we interpret\
  \ other people\u2019s behavior and our own, to the attribution of desires, motivations\
  \ and goals to it. We also discuss how our cognition works, and how our perceptual\
  \ systems process information. Other topics include the lack of correspondence between\
  \ our representations and the things outside in the world; how we interpret emotions;\
  \ the issue about preferences and personality; why we still need our mental illusions\
  \ to function properly; and if AI systems can also acquire them, namely emotions\
  \ and consciousness.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:06  The basic premise of \u201CThe Mind\
