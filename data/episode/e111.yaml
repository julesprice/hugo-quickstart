  \ of Mental Depth and The Improvised Mind\u201D.</p>\n<p>In this episode, the conversation\
  \ revolves around the main topics of Dr. Chater\u2019s book, The Mind is Flat. We\
  \ talk about the many illusions that compose our minds, from the way we interpret\
  \ other people\u2019s behavior and our own, to the attribution of desires, motivations\
  \ and goals to it. We also discuss how our cognition works, and how our perceptual\
  \ systems process information. Other topics include the lack of correspondence between\
  \ our representations and the things outside in the world; how we interpret emotions;\
  \ the issue about preferences and personality; why we still need our mental illusions\
  \ to function properly; and if AI systems can also acquire them, namely emotions\
  \ and consciousness.</p>\n<p>Time Links:</p>\n<p>01:06 The basic premise of \u201C\
  The Mind is Flat\u201D</p>\n<p>05:33 We are like fictional characters &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\
  <p>09:59 The problem with stories and narratives &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\
  <p>13:58 The illusions our minds create (about motives, desires, goals, etc.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\
  <p>17:44 The distinction between the conscious mind and brain activity &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\
  <p>22:34 Does dualism make sense?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>27:11 Is modularity of mind a useful\
  \ approach?</p>\n<p>31:21 How our perceptual systems work&nbsp;</p>\n<p>41:49 How\
  \ we represent things in our minds&nbsp;</p>\n<p>44:57 The Kuleshov effect, and\
  \ the interpretation of emotions &nbsp;</p>\n<p>52:05 About preferences and personality</p>\n\
  <p>55:42 Why do we need our mental illusions?</p>\n<p>59:10 The importance of our\
  \ imagination</p>\n<p>1:01:31 Can AI systems produce the same illusions (emotions,\
  \ consciousness)?</p>\n<p>1:04:53 Follow Dr. Chater\u2019s work! &nbsp;</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
