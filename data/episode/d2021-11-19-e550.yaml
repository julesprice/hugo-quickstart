shownotes: '<p>Dr. Jonathan Zimmerman is a Professor of History of Education at the
  University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education. Dr. Zimmerman is one of
  the foremost education historians working today. His work examines how education
  practices and policies have developed over time, and the myths that often cloud
  our understanding of teaching and learning. He has a particular interest in how
  political and social movements come to shape education. He is the author of several
  books, including the most recent one, Free Speech: And Why You Should Give a Damn.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on Free Speech. We start by defining free speech, and
  then walk through free speech in different domains, like politics, universities,
  the arts, and civil society. We talk specifically about free speech on social media
  in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. We discuss ways in which free speech is
  under threat, and historical precedents to it.</p>
