  \ and Law at Chapman University. He is a founding member of the Economic Science\
  \ Institute and founding member and Director of the Smith Institute for Political\
  \ Economy and Philosophy. His research uses experimental economics to explore the\

  <p>In this episode, we focus on The Property Species, and talk about Dr. Wilson\u2019\
  s work on this subject more broadly. We first discuss property from an evolutionary\
  \ perspective, and the endowment effect. We ask if property is a human universal.\
  \ We then talk about sharing, exchange, trade, and specialization. We discuss some\
  \ features of the human mind that play a role in how we think about property, like\
  \ abstract thinking, language, and morality. Dr. Wilson explains the difference\
  \ between property and property rights. We also talk about intellectual property,\
  \ and what we can learn about human sociality (focusing on how people cooperate)\
  \ by studying how people think about property. Finally, we ask if anarchy could\
  \ ever work, why social preferences are not preferences, and some thoughts on the\
  \ so-called \u201Csharing economy\u201D.</p>\n"
