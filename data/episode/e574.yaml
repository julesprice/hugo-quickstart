shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 30th 2021.  \nDr. Andreas Jungherr is Professor\
  \ for Political Science with a focus on the Governance of Complex and Innovative\
  \ Technical Systems at Otto-Friedrich-University Bamberg. He examines the impact\
  \ of digital media on politics and society. He has worked on the uses of digital\
  \ media and technology by publics, political actors, and organizations in international\
  \ comparison. He also addresses challenges for scientific research in reaction to\
  \ digital change in order to realize opportunities emerging from new data sources\
  \ and analytical approaches. In this, he has focused on harnessing the potential\
  \ of digital methods and computational social science while addressing methodological\
  \ challenges in its integration into the social sciences. He is the author of books\
  \ like Retooling Politics: How Digital Media are Shaping Democracy, and Analyzing\
  \ Political Communication with Digital Trace Data: The Role of Twitter Messages\
  \ in Social Science Research.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about political discourse\
  \ and political behavior, online and offline, and about online misinformation. We\
  \ talk about how complicated it is to draw inferences about people\u2019s political\
  \ preferences and behavior from digital data, and how digital media have changed\
  \ how political campaigns are done. We focus a lot on Twitter as a platform for\
  \ research on politics. We also discuss the impact of online misinformation. We\
  \ wrap things up with a positive evidence-based message for people who want to navigate\
  \ the digital world without becoming cynical.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n\
