  \ on the Governance of Complex and Innovative Technical Systems at Otto-Friedrich-University\
  \ Bamberg. He examines the impact of digital media on politics and society. He has\
  \ worked on the uses of digital media and technology by publics, political actors,\

  \ Communication with Digital Trace Data: The Role of Twitter Messages in Social\
  \ Science Research.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about political discourse and\
  \ political behavior, online and offline, and about online misinformation. We talk\
  \ about how complicated it is to draw inferences about people\u2019s political preferences\
  \ and behavior from digital data, and how digital media have changed how political\
  \ campaigns are done. We focus a lot on Twitter as a platform for research on politics.\
  \ We also discuss the impact of online misinformation. We wrap things up with a\
  \ positive evidence-based message for people who want to navigate the digital world\
  \ without becoming cynical.</p>\n"
