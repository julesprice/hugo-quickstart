shownotes: '<p>Dr. Marya Schechtman is an LAS Distinguished Professor of Philosophy,
  as well as a member of the Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience at the University
  of Illinois Chicago. Her main areas of interest are personal identity, practical
  reasoning, and bioethics. She is the author of books like The Constitution of Selves

  <p>In this episode, we talk about the self. We start by discussing what the self
  is, and its relationship with personal identity. We discuss if it is a narrative,
  if it is unitary, and if coherence is important. We also talk about the social aspects
  of the self, and ask if we can develop separate selves in virtual worlds.</p>
