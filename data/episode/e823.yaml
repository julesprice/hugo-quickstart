shownotes: "<p>Dr. Owen Flanagan is James B. Duke Distinguished Professor Emeritus\
  \ of Philosophy at Duke University. His work is in philosophy of mind and psychiatry,\
  \ ethics, moral psychology, and cross-cultural philosophy. He is co-author of Against\
  \ Happiness.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on Against Happiness.\
  \ We talk about the \u201Chappiness agenda\u201D, and what is promoted by advocates\
  \ of happiness as the ultimate goal. We discuss if this agenda is hedonist and utilitarian.\
  \ We talk about some philosophical issues, and criticisms of positive psychology.\
  \ We discuss what \u201Chappiness\u201D means, and issues with how it\nis measured.\
  \ We talk about different hierarchies of values across cultures. We discuss problems\
  \ with averaging subjective satisfaction scores and comparing countries, and how\
  \ norms can influence how people answer surveys. We talk about some of the politics\
  \ of this, and question if promoting happiness is a political virtue, if disadvantaged\
  \ people want it, and the example of feminism in China. Finally, we discuss what\
  \ cross-cultural work teaches us about norms and individual differences.</p>\n"
