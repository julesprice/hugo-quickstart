shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 7th, 2019.  \nDr. Christopher Stringer is a British\
  \ physical anthropologist noted for his work on human evolution. He is a Research\
  \ Leader in Human Origins at the Natural History Museum. His early research was\
  \ on the relationship of Neanderthals and early modern humans in Europe, but through\
  \ his work on the Recent African Origin model for modern human origins, he now collaborates\
  \ with archaeologists, dating specialists, and geneticists in attempting to reconstruct\
  \ the evolution of modern humans globally. He has excavated at sites in Britain\
  \ and abroad, and he directed the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain project from\
  \ 2001 until it finished in 2013. Now he\u2019s co-director of the follow-up Pathways\
  \ to Ancient Britain project, as part of their funding from the Calleva Foundation,\
  \ which has also contributed to the foundation of their new Centre for Human Evolution\
  \ Research. As well as many scientific papers, he\u2019s also written a number of\
  \ books, most recently, Britain: one million years of the human story (2014, with\
  \ Rob Dinnis) and Our Human Story (2018, with Louise Humphrey).\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we go through some topics about our evolutionary history. We discuss what is the\
  \ best account of our origins as H. sapiens; how hard it is to distinguish between\
  \ different hominin species; Out of Africa migrations, particularly by H. erectus,\
  \ and how we got from H. erectus to H. sapiens and Neanderthals. We also talk about\
  \ the limitations of modern dating techniques, and what we can learn from them and\
  \ from genetic analysis. We address the questions of how old are modern humans,\
  \ and what would have been our most important selective pressures. We then get into\
  \ the issue with the term \u201Crace\u201D, and distinguishing it from \u201Cpopulation\u201D\
  . Finally, we talk a bit about how we are still evolving, and some of the major\
  \ known unknowns of human evolution.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:09  The origins of H.\
