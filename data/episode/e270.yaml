shownotes: "<p>Dr. Christopher Stringer is a British physical anthropologist noted\
  \ for his work on human evolution. He is a Research Leader in Human Origins at the\
  \ Natural History Museum. His early research was on the relationship of Neanderthals\
  \ and early modern humans in Europe, but through his work on the Recent African\
  \ Origin model for modern human origins, he now collaborates with archaeologists,\
  \ dating specialists, and geneticists in attempting to reconstruct the evolution\
  \ of modern humans globally. Now he\u2019s co-director of the follow-up Pathways\
  \ to Ancient Britain project, as part of their funding from the Calleva Foundation,\
  \ which has also contributed to the foundation of their new Centre for Human Evolution\
  \ Research. As well as many scientific papers, he\u2019s also written a number of\
  \ books, most recently, Britain: one million years of the human story (2014, with\
  \ Rob Dinnis) and Our Human Story (2018, with Louise Humphrey).</p>\n<p>In this\
  \ episode, we go through some topics about our evolutionary history. We discuss\
  \ what is the best account of our origins as H. sapiens; how hard it is to distinguish\
  \ between different hominin species; Out of Africa migrations, particularly by H.\
  \ erectus, and how we got from H. erectus to H. sapiens and Neanderthals. We also\
  \ talk about the limitations of modern dating techniques, and what we can learn\
  \ from them and from genetic analysis. We address the questions of how old are modern\
  \ humans, and what would have been our most important selective pressures. We then\
  \ get into the issue with the term \u201Crace\u201D, and distinguishing it from\
  \ \u201Cpopulation\u201D. Finally, we talk a bit about how we are still evolving,\
  \ and some of the major known unknowns of human evolution.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow\
