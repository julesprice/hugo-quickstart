shownotes: "<p>Dr. Ian Crawford is Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology\
  \ at Birkbeck College, University of London. His research activities mostly lie\
  \ in the fields of space exploration (especially lunar science and exploration),\
  \ and the science of astrobiology (the search for life in the Universe).</p>\n<p>In\
  \ this episode, we talk about astrobiology and Big History. What is astrobiology,\
  \ and the criteria that are used to search for life in the Universe, and also the\
  \ limitations of those criteria, including the Goldilocks conditions (or the habitable\
  \ zone). Also, the life forms that we should expect to find on other planets, and\
  \ the places in our solar system which have the highest probabilities of hosting\
  \ life. The special case of looking for intelligent life, and the many complications\
  \ of it. The scientific, societal and political relevance of lunar and space exploration,\
  \ and why it\u2019s not in conflict with other human social and political endeavors.\
  \ And, finally, Big History, and the relationship between astrobiology and Big History.</p>\n\
