shownotes: "Dr. Nick Enfield is Professor and Chair of Linguistics at the University\
  \ of Sydney and director of the Sydney Centre for Language Research. His research\
  \ on language, culture, cognition and social life is based on long-term fieldwork\
  \ in mainland Southeast Asia, especially Laos. His latest book is Language vs. Reality:\
  \ Why Language Is Good for Lawyers and Bad for Scientists.\n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ focus on Language vs. Reality. We talk about the premise of the book of language\
  \ as both destroyer and creator. We discuss how language and reasoning are more\
  \ about convincing people, rather than getting at the truth. We talk about perception\
  \ and language as two steps of reduction of reality, and the idea of language as\
  \ an interface for coordination. We discuss how different languages capture different\
  \ aspects of reality. We get into psychological phenomena like priming and framing.\
  \ We talk about framing in politics and the media. We discuss the idea of public\
  \ discourse as a market for justifications, rather than a market for ideas. We go\
  \ through the functions of stories. We discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Finally,\
  \ we ask if we can know what are the best ways of talking about things.\n\nTime\
