shownotes: "<p>Dr. Philip Goff is a philosopher and consciousness researcher at Durham\
  \ University, UK. His main research focus is trying to explain how the brain produces\
  \ consciousness. He thinks we need to radically rethink our understanding of matter\
  \ in order to explain consciousness, in something like the way Einstein radically\
  \ rethought the nature of space and time. Dr. Goff also has a sideline in political\
  \ philosophy, focusing on issues pertaining to taxation, globalization and social\
  \ justice. He\u2019s also the author of the book Consciousness and Fundamental Reality.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we talk about consciousness, materialism and the nature of reality.\
  \ We start off by discussing the philosophy of materialism and its limitations when\
  \ it comes to account for phenomena like consciousness. We also talk about illusionism\
  \ as a theory of consciousness, and the difficulties in trying to understand consciousness\
  \ from an objectivist perspective, and the inherent limitations that our theory\
  \ of mind has. Then, Dr. Goff explains his approach to consciousness, and what he\
  \ thinks is the best way to know its nature, based on Russellian monism and panpsychism.&nbsp;</p>\n\
