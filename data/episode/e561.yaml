shownotes: '<p>Dr. Anna Warrener is an assistant professor in the Anthropology department
  at University of Colorado Denver. Her research focuses on the evolution of the human
  musculoskeletal system using biomechanical techniques to assess how variation in
  physical structure affects locomotor performance. She is specifically interested
  in the human pelvis and how its unique anatomy impacts both locomotion and human
  birth.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we talk about human bipedalism, the human pelvis, and childbirth.
  We start by talking about the major steps we took to evolve our modern human anatomy,
  starting with our last common ancestor with chimps and bonobos. We discuss how our
  pelvis had to evolve for us to become bipedal. We go through the major hypothesis
  out there to explain the evolution of human bipedalism. We discuss the relationship
  between human life history, brain size, and the evolution of the female pelvis.
  We ask to what extent childbirth for human females is problematic from an evolutionary
  perspective. We talk about sex differences on the level of the pelvis. We also talk
  about human altriciality, and timing of birth.</p>
