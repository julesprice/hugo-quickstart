shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 17th 2023.  \nDr. Kieran Setiya is Professor of Philosophy\
  \ at MIT. He works mainly in ethics, epistemology, and the philosophy of mind. He\
  \ is the author of Practical Knowledge, Reasons without Rationalism, Knowing Right\
  \ From Wrong, and, more recently, Life Is Hard: How Philosophy Can Help Us Find\
  \ Our Way.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Life Is Hard. We start by discussing\
  \ the purpose of philosophy. We talk about what makes life hard, and we discuss\
  \ if we should avoid hardship; complaining about hardship, and pitying other people;\
  \ and what a life well lived is. We get into topics like physical disability and\
  \ pain; loneliness; friendship; loss and grief; Stoicism; being a \u201Cfailure\u201D\
  , and what \u201Csuccess\u201D means; injustice; and the meaning of life. Finally,\
  \ we discuss if argumentation can change people\u2019s views on life.\n\nTime Links:\
