shownotes: "<p>Dr. Peter Jonason is Associate Professor of Psychology at the University\
  \ of Padova, Italy. By training he is a social/personality psychologist who uses\
  \ evolutionary theory to derive predictions and account for observable phenomena\
  \ in (mostly) personality, individual differences, mating strategies, and sexuality.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we focus on human mating behavior. We first talk about the relationship\
  \ between the Dark Triad traits and mating behavior, and also the costs associated\
  \ with them. Then we go through some specific topics, like the willingness to get\
  \ caught in an extra-pair relationship, the mate preferences of educated people,\
  \ and what we can learn about human mating by studying the booty call. Finally,\
  \ we talk about some of the psychological barriers to accepting findings in evolutionary\
  \ psychology.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Jonason\u2019s work:</p>\n<p>Personal\
