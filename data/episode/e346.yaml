shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 4th 2020.  \nDr. Peter Jonason is Associate Professor\
  \ of Psychology at the University of Padova, Italy. By training he is a social/personality\
  \ psychologist who uses evolutionary theory to derive predictions and account for\
  \ observable phenomena in (mostly) personality, individual differences, mating strategies,\
  \ and sexuality.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on human mating behavior. We first\
  \ talk about the relationship between the Dark Triad traits and mating behavior,\
  \ and also the costs associated with them. Then we go through some specific topics,\
  \ like the willingness to get caught in an extra-pair relationship, the mate preferences\
  \ of educated people, and what we can learn about human mating by studying the booty\
  \ call. Finally, we talk about some of the psychological barriers to accepting findings\
  \ in evolutionary psychology.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:04  Personality (the Dark Triad),\
  \ and mating behavior  \n06:20  Is there a connection between the Dark Triad traits\
