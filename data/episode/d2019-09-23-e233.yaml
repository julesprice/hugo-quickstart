  \ this episode, we focus mostly on Dr. Nesse\u2019s most recent book. We first talk\
  \ about the field of Evolutionary Medicine, and refer specifically to phenomena\
  \ like antagonistic pleiotropy and aging, evolutionary mismatch and modern disease,\
  \ and if we should approach diseases as adaptations. We then move on to discussing\
  \ issues in Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology; the classification of mental disorders;\
  \ studying emotions from an evolutionary perspective; and the Smoke Detector Principle.\
  \ We talk about depression, and how we haven\u2019t evolved to feel good or experience\
  \ wellbeing. In the latter part of the interview, we discuss Psychoanalysis and\
  \ the self-defense mechanisms, and also if people can benefit from learning about\
  \ how their minds operate, from an evolutionary standpoint.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>--</p>\n\
