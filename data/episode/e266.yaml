shownotes: "<p>Dr. Lyn Wadley is jointly Honorary Professor of Archaeology in the\
  \ School of Geography, Archaeology and Environmental Studies, and the Evolutionary\
  \ Studies Institute, at University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. She directs\
  \ a Wits-recognized programme called ACACIA (Ancient Cognition and Culture in Africa).\
  \ Her specialty is the African Stone Age: Middle Stone Age (which lasted from approximately\
  \ 300,000 to 25,000 years ago) and Later Stone Age (the last 25,000 years). She\
  \ began her career researching social and ecological issues during the past 25,000\
  \ years of the Later Stone Age in southern Africa. Data for her interpretations\
  \ were obtained from sites in Namibia and South Africa. Dr. Wadley\u2019s current\
  \ research is dedicated to the cognition of people who lived in the Middle Stone\
  \ Age.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about how we can learn more about the evolution\
  \ of human cognition through Archaeology. We discuss how we can make inferences\
  \ about human cognitive abilities from artifacts, and also their limitations. We\
  \ got through specific abilities, like imagination, planning, analogical reasoning,\
  \ multitasking, and symbolism, and how a big part of them have a social ingredient.\
  \ We address the question of what is a modern human. We also talk about the interplay\
  \ between technology and cognition. Dr. Wadley tells us what she learned by studying\
  \ the production of compound adhesives. Finally, we address topics like the respect\
  \ we should have for the cognitive capacity of people who lived in traditional societies;\
  \ the potential impact of modern culture in the evolution of our cognition; and\
  \ our shared human nature.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Wadley\u2019s work:</p>\n\
