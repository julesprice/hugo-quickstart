  \ University Professor with multidisciplinary appointments. &nbsp;Dr. Wakefield\u2019\
  s scholarly specialty is the conceptual foundations of clinical theory. He\u2019\
  s the author of several books, including The Loss of Sadness, and All We Have to\
  \ Fear.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about the concept of mental disorder, depression,\
  \ and anxiety. After addressing the issues with the definition of mental disorder,\
  \ we tackle depression, and discuss how to distinguish it from sadness and sorrow;\
  \ if it is really on the rise; what we know about its biology; and if and how psychotherapy\
  \ and antidepressants work. We then get into anxiety, its evolved functions; and\
  \ criticisms about the diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety. Finally, we\
  \ discuss potential issues in modern industrialized societies that might contribute\
  \ to depression and anxiety, and if normal anxiety and depression should be treated\
  \ clinically.</p>\n"
