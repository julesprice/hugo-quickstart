shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 30th 2022.  \nDr. Jerome Wakefield is a Professor\
  \ at NYU Silver as well as an NYU University Professor with multidisciplinary appointments,\
  \ particularly affiliate faculty in Philosophy and affiliate faculty in Bioethics.\
  \  Dr. Wakefield\u2019s scholarly specialty is the conceptual foundations of clinical\
  \ theory. Much of his recent work has concerned the concept of mental disorder,\
  \ especially how normal negative responses to a problematic social environment can\
  \ be distinguished from mental disorder and how DSM diagnostic criteria fail to\
  \ adequately draw this distinction. He\u2019s the author of several books, including\
  \ The Loss of Sadness: How Psychiatry Transformed Normal Sorrow into Depressive\
  \ Disorder, and All We Have to Fear: Psychiatry\u2019s Transformation of Natural\
  \ Anxieties into Mental Disorders.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the concept\
  \ of mental disorder, depression, and anxiety. After addressing the issues with\
  \ the definition of mental disorder, we tackle depression, and discuss how to distinguish\
  \ it from sadness and sorrow; if it is really on the rise; what we know about its\
  \ biology; and if and how psychotherapy and antidepressants work. We then get into\
  \ anxiety, its evolved functions; and criticisms about the diagnostic criteria for\
  \ generalized anxiety. Finally, we discuss potential issues in modern industrialized\
  \ societies that might contribute to depression and anxiety, and if normal anxiety\
  \ and depression should be treated clinically.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n\
