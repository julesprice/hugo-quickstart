shownotes: "<p>Dr. Colin Wright is Eberly Fellow in the Department of Biology at Pennsylvania\
  \ State University. His research explores the effects of animal personality on collective\
  \ behavior and colony success. Using a combination of laboratory and field experiments,\
  \ he tests for relationships between group personality composition, inter-colony\
  \ differences in collective behavior and behavioral flexibility, and colony performance.\
  \ He uses social spiders (genus Stegodyphus) and paper wasps (genus Polistes) to\
  \ probe these topics.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus on insect personality. We\
  \ start by discussing how we can properly study animal personality, and what it\
  \ is about. We also talk about insect personality at the individual and collective\
  \ levels, we ask if it can be facultative, and we refer to behavioral plasticity.\
  \ We also mention the impact of human intervention in these species\u2019 habitats,\
  \ group and multilevel selection, and how keystone individuals influence collective\
  \ learning and group success. We explore if it is possible to gain some insights\
  \ about animal personality that could be extrapolated from these insect societies\
  \ to other social animals. Finally, we go through some of the main topics of a Quillette\
  \ article by Dr. Wright, \u201CThe New Evolution Deniers\u201D, and refer to issues\
  \ regarding primarily sex and gender.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Wright\u2019\
