shownotes: "Dr. Paul Katsafanas is Associate Professor in the Department of Philosophy\
  \ at Boston University. He works on ethics, moral psychology, and nineteenth-century\
  \ philosophy. He\u2019s the author of the books Agency and the Foundations of Ethics:\
  \ Nietzschean Constitutivism, and The Nietzschean Self: Moral Psychology, Agency,\
  \ and the Unconscious.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about some of Nietzsche\u2019\
  s insights on human psychology, and how that relates to his moral philosophy. We\
  \ start off by discussing the importance of studying human nature to do good moral\
  \ philosophy, and the issues with some approaches in ethics like rationalism and\
  \ intuitionism. Then we get into some of Nietzsche\u2019s observations on the differences\
  \ between reflective and unreflective action; the dynamical relationships between\
  \ the conscious and the unconscious; and how concepts acquired through culture might\
  \ influence our thinking. Referring to topics directly related to morality and ethics,\
  \ we also talk about freedom, agency, and responsibility; Nietzschean drives; and\
  \ the Will. We finally discuss Nietzsche\u2019s morality, and if it was relativistic\
  \ or subjective.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:40  Studying human nature to do moral philosophy\
