shownotes: "<p>Dr. Andrew Norman teaches philosophy at Carnegie Mellon University.\
  \ He works on the conceptual and historical foundations of humanism. He has published\
  \ widely on the nature of reason and the teaching of wisdom, and written books on\
  \ critical thinking and the structure of dialogue. He is the author of Mental Immunity:\
  \ Infectious Ideas, Mind-Parasites, and the Search for a Better Way to Think.</p>\n\
  <p>In this episode, we focus on Mental Immunity. We first get into what cognitive\
  \ immunology is, and some aspects of how our cognition works, like epistemic vigilance,\
  \ and the fact that our reasoning functions better in social contexts. We discuss\
  \ how we determine that something is a \u201Cbad idea\u201D. We also discuss what\
  \ reason is, and how we can determine what a \u201Creasonable belief\u201D is. We\
  \ talk about critical thinking, and ideological thinking. We then go into how we\
  \ can justify holding beliefs that are not supported by the evidence, and the psychological\
  \ benefits of \u201Cwrong\u201D beliefs. We talk specifically about religion, the\
  \ Enlightenment, and moral values. Finally, we discuss strategies to improve cognition,\
  \ both individually and collectively, including the concept of \u201Cmind vaccine\u201D\
  \ and heard immunity.</p>\n"
