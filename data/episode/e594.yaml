shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 18th 2021.  \nDr. James Salzman is the Donald Bren\
  \ Distinguished Professor of Environmental Law with joint appointments at the UCLA\
  \ School of Law and at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at\
  \ UC Santa Barbara. In twelve books and more than 100 articles and book chapters,\
  \ his broad-ranging scholarship has addressed topics spanning drinking water, trade\
  \ and environment conflicts, ownership engineering, and creating markets for ecosystem\
  \ services. He is the author of Mine!: How the Hidden Rules of Ownership Control\
  \ Our Lives.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Mine! We talk about where our sense\
  \ of ownership comes from, and the six different stories of ownership people have.\
  \ We discuss if these stories are universal across societies and cultures, and how\
  \ people decide which one is the best. We talk about how ownership works differently\
  \ for intangible things, and how companies take advantage of people\u2019s sense\
  \ of ownership. We discuss the ownership principle of attachment, and how it can\
  \ be used to help solving climate change. Finally, we discuss if rules of ownership\
  \ need to be codified in the law.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:33  Where\
