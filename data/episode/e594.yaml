shownotes: "<p>Dr. James Salzman is the Donald Bren Distinguished Professor of Environmental\
  \ Law with joint appointments at the UCLA School of Law and at the Bren School of\
  \ Environmental Science &amp; Management at UC Santa Barbara. In twelve books and\
  \ more than 100 articles and book chapters, his broad-ranging scholarship has addressed\
  \ topics spanning drinking water, trade and environment conflicts, ownership engineering,\
  \ and creating markets for ecosystem services. He is the author of Mine!: How the\
  \ Hidden Rules of Ownership Control Our Lives.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we focus\
  \ on Mine! We talk about where our sense of ownership comes from, and the six different\
  \ stories of ownership people have. We discuss if these stories are universal across\
  \ societies and cultures, and how people decide which one is the best. We talk about\
  \ how ownership works differently for intangible things, and how companies take\
  \ advantage of people\u2019s sense of ownership. We discuss the ownership principle\
  \ of attachment, and how it can be used to help solving climate change. Finally,\
  \ we discuss if rules of ownership need to be codified in the law.</p>\n"
