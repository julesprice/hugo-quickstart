shownotes: "Dr. Paul Bloom is Professor Emeritus at Yale University and Professor\
  \ of Psychology at the University of Toronto. His research explores how children\
  \ and adults understand the physical and social world, with special focus on language,\
  \ morality, religion, fiction, and art. His new book is The Sweet Spot: The Pleasures\
  \ of Suffering and the Search for Meaning.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Sweet\
  \ Spot. We start with a few definitions (pleasure, suffering, happiness, and meaning).\
  \ We then get into topics like: the difference between chosen and unchosen suffering;\
  \ the relationship between happiness and meaning; motivational pluralism; the difference\
  \ between suffering for pleasure, and suffering for meaning; the role context plays\
  \ in how we valuate our experiences; the complicated interplay between pain and\
  \ pleasure; masochism, self-harm, and BDSM; the state of flow; boredom; the role\
  \ of imagination; how we derive pleasure from moral punishment; what people find\
  \ meaningful; narratives and meaning; why are so many people suffering in industrialized\
  \ societies; the Nozick experience machine, and if it is possible for people to\
  \ do without suffering; and where we can find the \u201Csweet spot\u201D.\n\nTime\
