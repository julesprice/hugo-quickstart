shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 29th 2022.  \nDr. Bernard Reginster is Professor of\
  \ Philosophy at Brown University. Dr. Reginster's research has focused mostly on\
  \ issues in ethics, metaethics, and moral psychology in 19th century German philosophy.\
  \ His new research interests include the topics of identity and intersubjectivity,\
  \ for which he considers ideas from psychoanalytic theory, 20th century Continental\
  \ philosophy, and contemporary Anglo-Saxon philosophy. He is the author of The Affirmation\
  \ of Life: Nietzsche on Overcoming Nihilism, which offers a comprehensive interpretation\
  \ of Nietzsche's ethical thought and includes substantial new interpretations of\
  \ some of his immediate predecessors, particularly Schopenhauer.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about The Affirmation of Life. We start by asking if Nietzsche\u2019s\
  \ philosophy was systematic at all. We get into nihilism, its relationship with\
  \ pessimism, where our values stem from, how we can revaluate them, and life-negating\
  \ and life-affirming values. We talk about happiness, suffering, meaningfulness,\
  \ and master and slave morality.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:55  Was Nietzsche\u2019\
