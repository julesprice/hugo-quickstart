shownotes: "<p>Dr. Bernard Reginster is Professor of Philosophy at Brown University.\
  \ Dr. Reginster's research has focused mostly on issues in ethics, metaethics, and\
  \ moral psychology in 19th century German philosophy. His new research interests\
  \ include the topics of identity and intersubjectivity, for which he considers ideas\
  \ from psychoanalytic theory, 20th century Continental philosophy, and contemporary\
  \ Anglo-Saxon philosophy. He is the author of The Affirmation of Life: Nietzsche\
  \ on Overcoming Nihilism, which offers a comprehensive interpretation of Nietzsche's\
  \ ethical thought and includes substantial new interpretations of some of his immediate\
  \ predecessors, particularly Schopenhauer.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we talk about\
  \ The Affirmation of Life. We start by asking if Nietzsche\u2019s philosophy was\
  \ systematic at all. We get into nihilism, its relationship with pessimism, where\
  \ our values stem from, how we can revaluate them, and life-negating and life-affirming\
  \ values. We talk about happiness, suffering, meaningfulness, and master and slave\
  \ morality.</p>\n"
