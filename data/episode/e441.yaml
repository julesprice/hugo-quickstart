  <p>In this episode, we talk about cryonics, lookism, abortion, academic freedom,
  and conscientious objection. We start with abortion, and refer to abortion before
  and after birth. We also discuss euthanasia, before moving on to cryonics, and life
  extension. We then talk about lookism, and discrimination against unattractive people,
  and what we can do about it. We talk briefly about conscientious objection applied
  to a medical context, focusing on abortion. Finally, we discuss academic Freedom,
  and the Journal of Controversial Ideas and its goals.</p>
