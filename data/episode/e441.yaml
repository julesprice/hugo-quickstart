shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 5th 2021.  \nDr. Francesca Minerva is a research\
  \ fellow at Warwick University and a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Ghent.\
  \ She is the co-founder and co-editor of the Journal of Controversial Ideas. Her\
  \ research focuses on applied philosophy, including lookism, conscientious objection,\
  \ abortion, academic freedom, and cryonics.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about cryonics,\
  \ lookism, abortion, academic freedom, and conscientious objection. We start with\
  \ abortion, and refer to abortion before and after birth. We also discuss euthanasia,\
  \ before moving on to cryonics, and life extension. We then talk about lookism,\
  \ and discrimination against unattractive people, and what we can do about it. We\
  \ talk briefly about conscientious objection applied to a medical context, focusing\
  \ on abortion. Finally, we discuss academic Freedom, and the Journal of Controversial\
  \ Ideas and its goals. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:34  Abortion, and euthanasia\
