  \ and the field of human systematics. We talk about the hominin clade and the genus\
  \ Homo, and how we distinguish between different species. We discuss some of the\
  \ main challenges in reconstructing human evolution. And we also touch on topics\
  \ such as hominin migrations, the relationship between H. sapiens and the Neanderthals,\
  \ and the limitations in studying ancient behavior.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Follow Dr.\
