shownotes: "<p>I would love to keep doing it for another 2 years, but to be honest,\
  \ I am broke.</p>\n<p>For these past two years, I have brought on the show some\
  \ of the top academics/scholars in a diversity of fields, like Psychology, Anthropology,\
  \ Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, Philosophy, and even Literary Studies.</p>\n\
  <p>Some of the biggest names that appeared throughout my 300 interviews include:\
  \ Noam Chomsky, Jerome Kagan, Randy Thornhill, Dale Purves, Michael Ruse, David\
  \ Buss, Simon Blackburn, Alexander Rosenberg, Terrence Deacon, Richard Shweder,\
  \ Diane Halpern, Robert Plomin, David Sloan Wilson, Richard Wrangham, Azar Gat,\

  \ well-researched, engaging, and fun interviews on topics that will feed your intellectual\
  \ interest.</p>\n<p>My income for these past two years has depended completely on\
  \ the donations made by my charitable patrons and Paypal supporters, but, unfortunately,\
  \ it is not enough.</p>\n<p>In today\u2019s society, scientific literacy is ever\
  \ more important, and, hopefully, I have been contributing to spread knowledge outside\
  \ of academia in a format that I try my best to be accessible even to laypeople.</p>\n\
