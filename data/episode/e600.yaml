shownotes: '<p>Dr. Katherine Freese is a professor of physics at the University of
  Texas at Austin, where she holds the Jeff and Gail Kodosky Endowed Chair in Physics.
  She is known for her work in theoretical cosmology at the interface of particle
  physics and astrophysics. She is the author of The Cosmic Cocktail: Three Parts
  Dark Matter.</p>

  <p>In this episode, we focus on The Cosmic Cocktail. We talk about percentages of
  ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy in the Universe, and how we got to
  them. We get into the history of theorizing about dark matter, what we know about
  it, potential particles, and its origins. We then move into dark energy. We also
  discuss the geometry of the Universe, gravity, and the future of the Universe.</p>
