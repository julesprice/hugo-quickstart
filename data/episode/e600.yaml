shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 6th 2021.  \nDr. Katherine Freese is a professor\
  \ of physics at the University of Texas at Austin, where she holds the Jeff and\
  \ Gail Kodosky Endowed Chair in Physics. She is known for her work in theoretical\
  \ cosmology at the interface of particle physics and astrophysics. She is the author\
  \ of The Cosmic Cocktail: Three Parts Dark Matter.\n\nIn this episode, we focus\
  \ on The Cosmic Cocktail. We talk about percentages of ordinary matter, dark matter,\
  \ and dark energy in the Universe, and how we got to them. We get into the history\
  \ of theorizing about dark matter, what we know about it, potential particles, and\
  \ its origins. We then move into dark energy. We also discuss the geometry of the\
  \ Universe, gravity, and the future of the Universe.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
